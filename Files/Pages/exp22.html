		<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				<p>Enzyme as Biological Catalysts</p>
<p>
				Living organisms are able to obtain and use energy very rapidly because of the presence of enzymes. Enzymes increase the rate of specific biochemical reactions and, therefore, are the catalysts of biological systems. Nearly all known enzymes are globular proteins that have specifically designed regions that attract and bind substrate molecules. These regions, called active sites, contain catalytic groups that are residues that directly participate in the making and breaking of bonds.</p>

				<p>
					The active site is a three-dimensional entity formed by groups that come from different parts of the linear acid sequence. The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme usually depends on this conformation. Consequently, changing the optimal 3-dimensional structure of an enzyme can sometimes cause distortion of its active site and reduce its efficiency as a biological catalyst.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Influence of pH on Enzymatic Activity</p>

				<p>
					One of the factors that play a significant role in maintaining an optimal and stable 3-dimensional structure of an enzyme is the overall charge of the surface of the enzyme protein. For this reason, pH conditions can greatly influence the activity of an enzyme. If the pH of the medium containing the enzyme becomes either too high or too low, the activity of the enzyme is often reduced. Any enzyme will, therefore, show catalytic function within a specific pH range. The variation of activity with pH is due to the change in the state of ionisation of the enzyme protein (and other compoments of the reaction mixture in some cases). In mammalian cells, various biochemical and physiological processes maintain optinal pH conditions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Objectives<br/>
				The main objective of the following experiment is to demonstate this <em>in vitro</em> and to make you appreciate the significance of pH on enzyme - catalysed reactions using &prop;- amylase as a model enzyme. Saliva contains &prop;-amylase which hydrolyses (1-4)-glycoisidic linkages ar random resulting in a mixture of glucose and free maltose. The effect of pH on the activity of &prop;-amylase will be demonstrated.

			MATERIALS
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Salivary amylase<br/>
			Preparation: Warm 200 ml of distilled water to body temperature. Rinse the mouth twice with warmed distilled water, which you subsequently discard. Swirl 40-50 ml of warmed distilled water around the mouth a few times to collect the saliva and collect the washing in a clean beaker. Dilute to 100 ml warmed distilled water and filter the diluted saliva through glass wool into a conical flask. Keep at 37 <sup>o</sup>C

Tube 8 will be the blank of the colorimetric measurements

Incubate 1-8 in a water bath at 37<sup>o</sup>C for about 5 minutes to bring the contents of the tubes to 37<sup>o</sup>C.  Add 1 ml of diluted saliva to each of tubes 1 - 7 and 1 ml of distilled water to tube 8 at 30 seconds intervals and mix well.  Stop the reaction after exactly 10 minutes with 5 drops of 20% NaOH and mix well.  Remove the tubes from the bath.

Add 0.2 ml of 5% Methylamine hydrochloride to each test tube, mix and immediately place the tubes to a boiling water bath and heat for 2 minutes.  At the end of this time, transfer the tubes to a water-bath at room temperature and leave to cool for about 3 minutes.

Set a spectrophotometer at wavelenght 520 nm and zero it with the blank solution in tube 8.  Reach the intensity of the carmine colour in each of the test tubes 1-7.  The  spectrophotometer recording for each tube is proportional to the amount of maltose formed and, therefore, is a measure of the velocity of the amylase action.

<em>NB: Please note the optimum pH for your saliva amylase for further use in Experiment 10</em>
