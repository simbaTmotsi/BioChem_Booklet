		<p>
		Welcome to the Biochemistry Department. We hope you will have a very educative and safe year. Take your time to read through theser simple rules. Do not jeopardise the safety of others and yourself because of ignorance.
		</p>
	</i>
	
	<h2>
		GOOD HABITS AND SAFETY IN THE LABORATORY
	</h2>

<p>
You must take personal responsibility for the safety. Rules do not make the laboratory safe, only people can minimise danger in the laboratory. Having stated this, a few basic considerations a listed below.
<p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Do not eat, drink, smoke or apply make-up in the laboratory.</li>
	<li>Do not pipette by mouth use pipetting devices.</li>
	<li>Wear disposable gloves while handling harmful chemicals and be aware that gloves are a source of contamination. Never touch your face with gloves.</li>
	<li>Carry out your operations in fume hoods if you are using a foul smelling compund.</li>
	<li>Exercise caution when using instruments such as centrifuges and electrophoresis power supplies that have potential of serious accidents. If you are uncertain about the proper procedures, or if there is any doubt as to how to use a piece of equipment <mark><strong>ask.</strong></mark></li>
	<li>Inform your instructors immediately of any dangerous situation that you notice or if any accidents occur however minor must it be.</li>
	<li>Immediately clean up any spills on any benche tops, around instruments, or on the floor. Floor spills can be slippery and dangerous. In other words, all students must clean up their own mess.</li>
	<li>Clearly label samples, reagent bottles and stock solutions with the chemical identity of contents, your name and date of preparation.</li>
	<li>Preferably use a marker for labelling test tubes and beakers. Sticking labels are very difficult to remove when cleaning your glassware.</li>
	<li>Do not run in the laboratory even in an emergency. It causes others to panic - walk briskly.</li>
	<li>Do not perform any action designed to startle, inconvinince, or otherwise jeorpadise the safety of another.</li>
	<li>No sitting on the workbenches. Stools are provided for this purpose. No listening to walkmans in the laboratory. Laboratories are not meant to be playgrounds.</li>
	<li>Any queries regarding glassware, equipment and chemicals see the Technicians on duty.</li>
	<li>Any breakages will be charged to thw deposit account of the student responsible.</li>
	<li>Apparatus borrowed from the storeroom must be signed for, if this is <mark>not crossed off</mark> the form by the student(s) on returning the apparatus, it will be charged to the student's account, the cost being split or charged individually as required.</li>
	<li>The Preparation Room/Instrument Room and Chemical Store are out of bounds to students.</li>
	<li>The Emergency Exit is not to be used for normal entering and leaving the laboratory.</li>
	<li><b>Always ensure that your centrifuge tubes are balanced before loading them into the machine. NO KEY NO PRACTICAL</b></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		EATING, DRINKING AND SMOKING<br>
	</h2>
	Unopened or opened beverages and foodstuffs shall not be taken into or stored in the laboratory.<br>
	<small>Students shall wash their hands before leaving the laboratory and also when temporarily vacating during working hours.</small>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		DRESSING<br>
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Items of clothing not worn in the laboratory may not be left in places where they present a hazard.</li>
		<li>Shoes with closed footwear <mark><b>only</b></mark> shall be worn in the laboratory. No high-heeled shoes or sandals are allowed in the laboratory <b><em>LEATHER SHOES ONLY.</b></em></li>
		<li>All students and staff in a laboratory shall wear Lab coats. Students shall enter the Laboratory already wearing Lab coats, which shall be kept buttoned at all times.</li>
		<li>Long hair shall be restrained by a net or a tied back.</li>
		<li>Do not wear caps or hats in the laboratory.</li>
		<li><b><em>For whatever reason you  will not be allowed to carry out a practical without a Lab coat.</em></b></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		DO NOT<br/>
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Switch between workgroups/practical groups without permission.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pour organic wastes down the drain. Ask for a waste disposal bottle.
		</li>
		<li>
			Leave the  laboratory with unsigned raw results. Otherwise the laboratory report will be rejected and a mark of zero awarded.
		</li>
		<li>
			Copy another student's work. This will result in a heavy loss of marks. You will be reffered to thr Course Co-ordinator and eventually to the Head of the Biochemistry Department.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		PLEASE NOTE
	</h2>
	The Pre-Practical Quiz is very important and has a major contribution to your final practical mark, so take it seriously. Although the quiz might contain some information in the Practical Schedule, you are also expected to do a background reading of the techniques for the week's practical. So do not be surprised if you are asked some questions which are not derived from the Practical Schedule.<br/>
	Any failure to report to a practical due to sickness must be supported by a letter from a registered Medical Practitioner(<b>not from a n'anga/inyanga</b>) otherwise a mark of zero will be awarded.<br/>
	If during the course of the practical you are unsure of anything, please raise your hand and you will be attended to.<br/>
	Always hand in your practical write-ups well before the next week's Practical Day.<br/>
	Finally ensure that you sign a Practical Attendance Register before you leave the laboratory.
