CARBOHYDRATE TESTS

</h2>

Introduction

<p>
 Carbohydrates are found extensively in all living organisms.  They are found in associationwith proteins, lipids and are important components of nucleic acids.  Carbohydrates thjerefore occur in greater or lesser proportions in all the main biological polymers.  Do you think that this ubiquitous occurrence of carbohydrates is significant?  Could it be related to the evolution of biological molecules and life on earth?
</p>

<p>
Carbohydrates contain only a limited number of functional groups which include mainly carbonyl and hydrozxl groups.  Occasionally other groups such as carboxyl amino and sulphate groups are also found.  The fact that carbohydrates contain only carbonyl and hydroxl groups makes it rather difficult to an alyse them selectively.  Because all carbohydrates contain more of less the same functional groups it is very difficult to distinguish between them.  Whereas it is, for example, relatively easy to distinguish between the amino acids alanine and lysine, it is very difficult to distiguish between glucose and ribose or galactose.
</p>

<p>
In spite of what has been said above, it is possible, if reaction conditions are chosen carefully to run tests that are quite selective and can distiguish between ketoses and aldoses or hexoses and pentoses.  Some of these tests are included in  this week's exercise.
</p>

<p>
Polysaccharides are quite unreactive and, in general need to be hydrolyses to monomers before meaningful tests  can be made.  An exception is the classic reaction between iodine and starch.  Even this, however,is not a chemical reaction the usual sence of the term
</p>

<p>
Molisch's Test<br/>
All carbohydrates are dehydrated by concentrated sulphuric acid to form furfural or its derivatives.  These products easily condenses with a naphthol and other phenolic compounds to give brightly coloured compounds.
</p>

<p>
Benedict's Test<br/>
Under suitable conditions carbohydrates with a free aldehyde or ketone group will act as reducing agents.  The reducing power is enhanced in alkaline solution.  In several reagents used in the analysis of carbohydrates the copper 11 ion is the oxidising agent.  On reduction the cooper 11 ions are converted to brown cuprous oxide
</p>

<p>
Barfoed's Test<br/>
Monosaccharides are more easily oxidised by cupric reagents than disaccharides and this forms the bais of the Barfoed test.
</p>

<p>
Reagents:
</p>
Molisch's reagent<br/>
Dissolve 5 g or-naphthol in 100 ml ethanol
<p>
Benedict's Solution
<ol type="1">
<li>Dissolve 173 g sodium citrate, add 100g Na <sub>2</sub>  CO<sub>3</sub> in about 600ml distilled water (solution a).</li>
<li> Dissolve 17.3 g CuSO<sub>4</sub> .5H<sub>2</sub>O in about 100ml distilled water (solution b).</li>
<li> Add solution (b) to solution (a).</li>
</ol>
Make up to 1 litre with distilled water. Filter off any insoluble material.

<p>
	Barfoed Reagent<br/>
	dissolve 10 g of cupric acetate in 200 ml distilled water. Add 5 ml, 40 % acetic acid.
</p>	

<p>
<ol type="I">
	<li> Molisch's Test
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Place 1ml each of a 1% solution of D-glucose, D-xylose, sucrose, starch and a suspension of cellulose into test tubes.</li>
			<li>Add 2 drops of 5% alcohol <big>&alpha;</big>-naphthol solution.</li>
			<li>Mix well and add 3ml of concentrated sulphuric acis very carefully. This can be done by tilting the tube at a 45<sub>o</sub> degree and pouring the acid down the side of the test tube to form a layer under the aqueous solution.</li>
			<li>Observe and describe the colour at the interface. Gentle swirling may be necessary.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
<br/>
	<li>
		Benedict's Test
		<p>
		You will be provided with some or all the solutions listed below:</p>
		1. Sugar Solutions:<br/>
		Glucose (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.02% and 1%)<br/>
		1% sucrose<br/>
		1% starch<br/>
		2% lactose

	</li>

</p>
<p>
	Method
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Place 5ml of Benedict's solution into a boiling tube.</li>
		<li>Add 8 drops of sugar or water and place in a boiling water bath. After 5 min set aside to cool.</li>
		<li>Carefully record your observations</li>
	</ol>
</p>

Questions
<ol type="1">
	<li>Give an estimate of the sensitivity of Benedict's test, that is, estimate the lowest concentration of reducing sugar that the method is able to detect
	</li>
	<li>How specific is Benedict's test?</li>
	<li>What constitute's urine and blood might interfere with this test?</li>
	<li>What is the role of each component of Benedict's solutions?</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<li>Hydrolysis test for sucrose</li>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Filter off any precipitate formed in the Bernedict's test that you did with glucose, sucrose and lactose.</li>
		<li>Add 1.5ml concentrated hydrolic acid.</li>
		<li>Place the tubes in a boiling water bath for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the bath and cool.</li>
		<li>
			To each tube add solid Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in small portions until no more gas is evolved upon addition of more Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
		</li>
		<li>Heat the tubes for 5 to 15 minutes and examine for reducing sugars.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Question</p>
<p>	Explain the reactions involved. Where possible give chemical equations.
</p>
	<li>
		<p>Barfoed's Test<br/></p>
		You will be provided with the solutions listed below to make your tests;<br/>
		&emsp;1% glucose<br/>
		&emsp;1% xylose<br/>
		&emsp;1% sucrose<br/>
		&emsp;unknown
	</li>
</ol>
To 2.5 ml Barfoed's reagent add 1 ml of test solution and place in a boiling water bath. Barfoed's reagent is weakly acidic and is reduced rapidly by monosaccharides only (marked orange-red precipitate in 5-7 minutes). Reducing disaccharides require a considerably longer time (about 10 minutes) .
