PROTEIN DETERMINATION: MISCELLANEOUS METHODS
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>
	A  variety of methods, none of which is entirely specific for proteins, are available for determination of the protein content of a given sample.  The methods employ different principles, and may be sensitive to interferences by certain salts, by buffer components and by some solvents.  Each method therefore has certain unique and useful characteristics as well as certain limitations.

</p>

<p>
	Good general references detailing the most common metnods are the papers by Layne and by Peterson in Mehods in Enzymology.  All of the methods cited there have one feature in common:  they must be standardized against some pure; known protein, usually crystalline bovline serum albumin.  Two additional methods are available which do not require secondary standardization.  The first of these the Kjeldahl method, in which the nitrogen content of a protein is converted to NH<sub>3</sub>.  The NH<sub>3</sub> can be collected and titrated directly with gravimetrically standardized HCI.  The second direct procedure is that of Dumas.  Here the protein is thermally oxidized in  the presence of CuO which serves as an oxygen source.  The gaseous oxidation products include N2 gas, resulting from the protein breakdown.  It is the volume of  the bubble of N2 that is measured, under standard condtions of temperature and pressure.

</p>

<p>
	Fluorescence methods of high sensitivity are available in which a reagent - for example, fluorescamine or 0-phthaladehyde - becomes intensely fluorescent only after reacting with a functional group in the protein.  For the two reagents just mentioned, free amino groups are so derivatized. 

</p>

<p>
	Many dyes are noncovalently bound to proteins.  Methyl orange, phenolphthalin (not the indicator, phenolphthalein), 4-hydroxyzaobelnzene-2-carboxylic acid (HABA) and Coomassie Blue (anazolene sodium) are examples.  Various analytical methods based on dy binding have been proposed, but few have stood the test of time, for various reasons.  A revival of interest in these procedures is examplified by the  method of Bradford based on use of Coomassie Blue.  In this procedure the absorption maximum of Coomassie Blue shifts from 465nm to 595nm when the ddye binds to a protein.  You will have the opportunity to test this method.	

</p>

<p>
	What must be clealry understood is that each method capitalizes on the presence in the protein of a particular structure - for example, the aromatic amino acid content (ultraviolet method) or lysine content (o-phthalaldehyde method) - and this structure may vary in occurrence among various proteins.

<b>LOWRY PROTEIN DETERMINATION</b><br/>
MATERIALS and REAGENTS
<ol type="1">
	<li>0.1% (w/v) CuSO4.5HO, 0.2 (w/v) sodium potasium tartrate, 10% (w/v) Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3.</sub> Prepare by dissolving Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>in about one half the final desiredvolume (for this experiment, in about 1000ml divide by 2 = 500ml).  Add this slowly  to the copper sulfare-tartrate solution with stirring (also in about 500ml).  This is asolution A: it is stable at about 10<sup>0</sup>C: at lower temperatures, carbonates may crystallize.
	
	<li>5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphates (SDS) (solution B) </li>
	<li>0.8 M NaOH (Solution C)</li>
	<li>BSA (bovine serum albumin<, 0.3mg/ water - 300ug/ml water.
	</li>
	<li>Lysozyme, o.3mg/ml water. </li>
	<li>Unknown protein solution</li>
	<li>3 M KCL</li>
	<li>1 M Tris-HCI (pH 7.5)</li>
	<li>5% (w/v) Triton X-100</li>
	<li>0.25 M Dithiothreitol</li>

</ol>

<b>PROCEDURE</b>
<ol type="1">
<li>Turn on spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up.</li>
<li>Number ten 10 <big>&times;</big> 150 mm test tubes and place them in a test tube rack.  In each tube, carefully pipette one of the following volumes of a 0,3mg/ml BSA solution: 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0ml, bring all tubes to a final volume of 1ml by adding the appropriate amount of water.  If a double beam spectrophotometer is used, prepare double the volume of the "O" ml or blank tube.</li>
<li>Set up two tubes containing 0.14 ml of lysozyme in a final volume of 1.0ml</li>
<li>The protein concentration of your unknown solution will be between 0.1mg/ml and 1.0 mg/ml.  Set up three tubes with different amounts of your  unknown in a final volume of 1.0ml  You are using different amountsof protein in hopes of finding at least one that falls within the range of standards.</li>
<li>Set up and number four tubes, each containing 0.14 ml BSA and 0.66ml HO.
	
	<ol type="a">
		<li>To tube 1 only, add 0.1ml of 3M KCI.</li>
		<li>To tube 2 only, add 0.1ml of 5% Triton X-100.</li>
		<li>To tube 3 only, add 0.1ml of 0.25M Dithiothreitol.</li>
		<li>To tube 4 only, add 0.2ml of 1M Tris - HCI (pH 7.5)</li>
		Bring all tubes to a final volume of 1.0ml with purified water
	</ol>
</li>
<li>In a 125 ml Ehrlenmeyer (conical) flask mix 10ml of solution A with 20ml 0fsolution B and 10ml of solution C. Mix carefully.  </li>
<li>Add 1.0ml of the solution from step 6 to each of your sample tubes (for double-beam instruments add 2.0ml to blank tube) Vortex them to mix thoroughly after each additon. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 10min.</li>
<li>While the tubes are being incubated, add 10ml of 2N Folin-Ciocaleau phenol reagent to 50ml distilled water in a 125-ml Ehrlenmeyer flask and mix thoroughly.</li>
<li>At the conclusion  of the 10min incubation period, forcibly pipette 0.5ml of the yellow solution from step 8 into each sample tube and vortex immediately and thoroughly.  (For double beam instruments, add 1.0ml into the blank tube.0) </li>
<li>Incubate the samples the samples at room temperature for 30min. </li>
<li>Determine the absorbance of each sample at a wavelenght of 540nm.   Since all absorbance readings will be made at wavelenghts in the visible range.  Disposable plastic cuvets may be used.  Polystyrene cuvettes will transmit about 80% of incident light of wavelengths of >330nm: acrylic has the same transmittance for wavelenghts > 300 nm.  Scan the visible spectrum (400-600nm) of the 0.2-, 0.4-, and 0.6-ml BSA standard tubes.  Record each scan, superimposing each curve on the sam portion of the chart paper.  </li>
</ol>

<b>REPORT</b>
<ol type="1">
	<li>On a sheet of graph, construct a graph of A54- (y axis) vs. (BSA) (x axis).  Label  the x axis in microgram (um) of BSA.  Calculate the micropolar extinction coefficient for the protein:Cu:phosphotungstate-phosphomolybdate complex.  </li>
	<li>Determine the protein the protein concentration of the standard lysozyme solution on the basis of the BSA standard curve.  Explain any difference from the predicted value. </li>
	<li>Determine the concentration of your unknown protein solution. </li>
	<li>Report the results from the four tubes in step 5:
