CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LIPIDS
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>
	We all tend to think of living systems as having evolved from an aqueous milieu, and therefore that the chemical components of the cell are polar substances, readily soluble in water.  However, critical to the formation of any cellur structur and range of cell functions, are the heterogeneous  group of biological compounds known as lipids.  The main characteristic of these lipids molecules are their solubility in non-polar organic solvents, such as benzene, ether, chloroform or slightly more polar solvents as methanol or acetone.

</p>

<p>
	They can be be subdivided into simple lipids consisting of fatty acid esters which yield fatty acids and alcohol (or sterols)  on hydrolysis; and complex lipids which also contain phosphoric acid, nitrogeneous compounds (sphingosine, ethanolamine, choline etc) and various carbohydrates.

</p>

<p>
	The edible fats and oils we find at home are triglycerides, i.e. esters of glycerol  and fatty acids.  Glycerol can form mesters with one, two or three of its hydroxl groups thus forming mono, di-, or tri-glycerides.  A major biological mfunction of the glycerides is storage and transport of metabolic energy.  While waxes, hydrocarbons, and fatty alcohol, the most non polar lipids, function primarily in forming protective surface on plants and animals.  Some aquatic animals (e.g whales) can use waxes for energy storage.

</p>

<p>
	Some of the most important lipids are those that serve as structural components of biological membranes - separating aqueous compartments within the organ  and the cell. All members of this group are amphipathic (phospholipids, sphingolipids and sterol the latter two are usually absent from bacterial membranes).

</p>

<p>
	Finally there is a large group of miscellaneous lipids, generally of lower molecular weight, (terpenes, steroids, prostaglandins and quinones) that include the hormones and vitamins.

Apparatus and Miscellaneous
<p>
	Boiling water<br/>
	Separating funnel<br/>
	Ice
</p>

<p>Experimental</p>

<p>
	The sample samples consist of either free fatty acids, glycerides or a phospholipid (lecithin).  Ideentify the samples.  If preliminary tests of solubility and emulsifying action indicate that the substance  is a complex lipid, it is not necessary to carry out Experiement 2.



<ol type="1">
	<li><p>The solubility of fats</p>
	To 2 drops of vegerable oil, or a little fat, in kindividual test tubes add about 3 ml of (a) ether (b) chloroform (c) petroleum ether (d) carbon tetrachloride (e)acetone (f) cold and (g) hot 90% ethanol.  Observe solubility in these solvents.  If solution  is not evident place a few drops of the solvent phase on  a piece of writing paper.  If some of the fat has dissolved, a translucent spot will be left after evaporation of the solvent.

	</li>

	<li><p>Test for unsaturation</p>
		<p>2 or 3 drops (or about 0.1g) of the lipid are dissolved or suspended in 2 ml of carbon tetrachloride, and a 1 % solution of bromine in carbon tetrachloride is added dropwise.  If the bromine colour disappears without evolution of hydrogen bromide, unsaturation is indicated.



		</p>

		<p>
			If only one or two drops of bromine are decolourized, the test should be taken as negative (due to impurities), since if the quantities suggested are used, an ethylenic substance should decolourize several drops of the reagent.  Add bromine to 2 ml of carbon tetrachloride not containing lipid as a control. 

		</p>
	</li>

Properties of lecithin

	<p>
		Complex lipids like lecithin are characterised by lower solubility in non-polar solvent like petroleum ether and higher solubility in more polar likechloroform and alcohol, but a special property of lecithin is its complete insolubility in acetone.

	</p>

	<li>
		<p>Emulsifying action</p>

		Place 3 ml of water in two test tubes: to both add 2 drops olive oil, and to one of them add an additional 2-3 drops of the lecithin in 90% alcohol.  Shake the tubes well and allow to stand.
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>Hydrolysis oflecithin</p>
		
		<p>
		Dissolve a small spatula head of lecithin i n 6 ml  of 95% ethanol by heating in  a 50 ml breaker on a water bath.  When dissolved.  heat the solution to  the boiling point, and add 6 ml of 2 M HC1.  Futher heat the mixtures on the steam bath until the reaction mixture is concentrated to about 1-2 ml.  Cool breaker in iced water ad extract the reaction product twice in a separating funnel with 10 ml portions of ether decanting the ether extracts into  a 50 ml conical flask.

		</p>
To the other insoluble portion add 6 ml of water and keep the solution separated into:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>an ether soluble, and</li>
			<li>a water soluble fraction</li>
		</ol>

			identification of hydrolysis products
	</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
	<p>Fatty acids</p>

	To a small porcelain dish evaporate approximately 5 ml of the ether soluble fraction on a boiling water bath.  (Caution! Do it in  a fume cupboard without  the presence of an open flame).  Test the solubility of the acids in dilutedsodium hydroxide.

	</li>

	<li>
	<p>Detectionn of glycerol</p>	

	Place 3 ml of water soluble fraction in a test tube, add 1 ml of 2% sodium hypochlorite and boil for one minute.  Add 3-4 drops of conc.  HCI and boil one minute to remove the chlorine.  Dilute to a volume of 5 ml and add an equal volume of a 1% orcinol solutionin conc.  HCI. Mix and heat to boiling.
	If directions have been followed, a fine violet colour will be produced.

	In this reaction most of the glycerol is oxidized by the hypochlorite to dihydroxyacetaone na d part glyceraldehyde.  These compounds condense with orcinol forming coloured compounds.

	</li>

	<li>
		<p>Detection of phosphoric acid</p>

		Place 3 ml of the water soluble fraction in a test tube, add 2 ml of conc.  HNO<sub>3</sub>, 4 ml of ammonium molybdate solution and keep for 5 minutes in a boiling water bath.  The appearance of a yellow precipitate will indicate the presence of phosphoric acid.
