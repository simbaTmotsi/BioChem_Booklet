CELL DIFFERENTIATION BY GRAM'S STAIN
	</big>
</pre>
</h2>

<p>
	INTRODUCTION<br/>
	The Gram stain is the most commonly used stain to initially identify bacteria. It was developed by a Danish Doctor, Hans //christian Gram, in 1884. Bacteria have one of two types of cell wall and the Gram stain uses Crystal violet to differentially stain the two different cell wall types. Bacteria that have a simple, thick cell wall containing a large amount of peptidoglycan retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and look purple/brown when viewed with a microscope. These bacteria are classified as Gram positive bacteria. Bacteria that are not stained by crystal violet are referred to as Gram negative. These bacteria have a thin cell wall containing less peptidoglycan and have an adddition outer membrane.
</p>

<p>
	Crystal violet is taken up by both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. When Iodine is added to the cells large insoluble crystal violet-Iodine crystals are formed. This step is commonly referred to as fixing the dye, The cells are then washed with a decolouriser, a mixed solvent of ethanol and acetone. The decolouriser dissolves the lipid outer membrane of the Gram-negative cells. The removal of the lipid layer enhances the leaching of the primary stain from the cells into the surrounding solvent. In contrast, the solvent dehydrates the thicker Gram-positive cell wall and prevents the stain-iodine complex from diffusing out of the cell, hence, the cells remain stained. The decolourisation step is critical and must be timed correctly. If the decolorizing agent is left on the cells for too long the stain will be removed from both types of cells. Some Gram-positive cells can also lose the stain more easily and therefore, may appear Gram negative.
</p>

<p>
	Although not essential, a counterstain of safranin is applied to the smear to dye the decolourised Gram-negative cells with a pink color. The size and shape of both types of cells can, thus, be more easily observed under a microscope. At the same time, they can be differentiated by the imparted color. If desired, the slides can be permanently mounted and preserved for record keeping.
</p>

<p>
	Gram's stain ranks among the most important diagnostic tools in microbiology but there are a wide range of staining methods available. By using appropriate dyes, different parts of the cell structure such as capsules, flagella, granules or spores can be stained. These staining techniques are widely used to visualize those components that are otherwise too difficult to see under an ordinary light microscope. Detection of certain cell components can alllow for a relatively simple scheme of differentiation or identification of different bacteria.

NOTE: These dyes will stain almost anything including your skin and lab coat. Wash off any spilled stain immediately with water to avoid leaving permanent marks on yourself, in the sink, lab bench or glassware.

<p>
	<b>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</b><br/>
	You will be provided with two known bacterial cell cultures and you are required to determine their cell wall type based on the Gram stain. In addition, you are expected to describe the basic cell morphology of these bacteria as seen under a microscope.
</p>
Gram Stain: Smear preparation & staining
<ol type="1">
	<li>
		Transfer a drop of the bacterial culture to be examined on a slide with an inoculation loop.
	</li>
	<li>
		Spread the culture with an inoculation loop to an even thin film over a circle of about 1.5 cm in diameter, approximately the size of a cover slide.
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>A typical slide can simultaneously accomodate 3 to 4 small smears if more than one culture is to be examined.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

<li>
	Using forceps, air-dry the culture.
</li>
<li>
	Fix the culture on the slide by moving the slide over a gentle flame in a circular fashion.
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			The heat helps the cells stick to the glass slide so that you can rinse the smear with staining solutions without significant loss of culture.
		</li>
		<li>
			NOTE: ring patterns that make visualization under the microscope more difficukt, can form if heating is not uniform.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Add about 5 drops of crystal violet stain over the fixed culture and leave to stand for 60 s.
</li>
<li>
	After 60 s, pour off the stain and gently rinse with a stream of water from a wash bottle.
</li>
<li>
	Add about 5 drops of the iodine solution to the smear, enough to cover the fixed culture, and leave for 30 s.
</li>
<li>
	Pour off the iodine solution and rinse the slide with running water. Shake off the excess water from the surface.
</li>
<li>
	Add a few drops of decolouriser solution until it overflows and rinse off with water after 5 s.
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			The exact time to stop adding decolouriser is when the solvent is no longer coloured as it overflows the slide. If you add too much decolouriser the stain will be completely removed from the Gram-positive cells and you will get inaccurate results
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	Counterstain with 5 drops of the safranin <em>O</em> solution for 20 seconds.
</li>
<li>
	Wash off the red safranin solution with water.
</li>
<li>
	Blot with tissue to remove the excess water or shake the slide to removw most of the water and air-dry.
</li>
<li>
	Examine the finished slide under a microscope. Note the colour (staining properties) and shape and features of the cells. Discuss your results in your write up.
</li>
