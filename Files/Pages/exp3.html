Experiment 3
		
ISOLATION AND FRACTIONATION OF LYMPOCYTES
	</big>
</pre>
</h2>

<p>
Lympocytes habe been studied extensively. They produce antibodyand mediate the cellular immune response, both of which involve specifix interactions with a variety of other cells and soluble factors. They can be isolated as a suspension of highly viable cells and are an attractive object of study both in their own right and as models for other nucleated cells.
</p>

<p>
	Peripheral blood is a convenient starting material in large animals. Cannulation of the thoracic duct provides another source of lympocytes in suspension. Various solid tissues notably tonsil, spleen, thymus and mesenteric lymph nodes are also used frequently. Lympocytes obtained from blood and lymph are nearly 100% viable. Disruption of solid tissue breaks about half of the lympocytes but the dead cells can  be removed to yield a 90 - 95 % viable preparation.
</p>

<p>
	Separation of lympocytes, erythrocytes, platelets and plasma<br/>
	Material and equipment (all sterile if the cells are to be cultured)<br/>
	Animal blood freshly collected in heparin (10 i.u./ml) 30 ml.<br/>
	Dextran molecular weight 250 0000 (BDH, Sigma) 3,5 % (w/v) in 0.15 M sodium chloride<br/>
	Hepes buffered BMEE medium<br/>
	Heparin, 1000 i.u./ml, preservation free.<br/>
	Isopaque-Ficoli mixture - Ficoli-Paque or Lmphoprep or Histopaque (pharmacia, Nycomed, sigma)<br/>
	Polystyrene conical-bottomed universal container 24mm <big>&times;</big> 90 mm.<br/>
	Polystyrene conical-bottomed screw-capped tubes 30 mm <big>&times;</big> 115 mm.<br/>
</p>

<p>
	Isolation of lympocytes from blood<br/>
	Lympocytes can be isolated easily from peripheral blood by density gradient sedimentation after depletion of the erythrocytes content. Thid is a bit complicated but good harvest can be obtained of plasma, platelets, erythrocytes and lymphocytes from one blood sample. More details are available to isolate from solid tissue.
</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Layer carefully 10 ml of heparinised blood on top of 20 ml of Ficoli-Isopaque or Lymphoprep and centrifugr at 3000 rpm  for 25 min, taking care not to disturb the gradient fluid underneath (temperature should be less than or equal to 20<sup>o</sup> C).
	</li>
	<li>
		Viable lympocytes accumulate as a white turbid layer on top of the Lymphoprep layer. Erythrocytes and dead cells sediment to the bottom of the tube, Plasma is aspirated first using a Pasteur pipette making sure not to disturb the white layer.
	</li>
	<li>
		Transfer the lympocyted(buffy white layer) to a fresh 50 ml Falcon tube using Pasteur pipette, add wash the cells by making up to 50 ml with RPMI/PBS media.
	</li>
	<li>
		Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discard the supernatant and retain the pellet. Re-suspend the pellet in 1 ml RPMI/PBS and dissolve the pellet by tapping onthe Falcon tube.
	</li>
	<li>
		Take 20 <big>&micro;</big>l of cells into an eppendorf tube and add 80 <big>&micro;</big>l trypan blue and count the cells on a haemacytometer using a light microscope at <big>&time;</big>40 magnification.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	COUNTING CELLS AND DETERMINING VIABILITY<br/>
	Materials and equipment<br/>
	Eosin, sodium salt, 0.5 % (w/v) in 0.9 %(w/v) sodium chloride<br/>
	Counting chamber, improved Neubauer ruling with thick covers<br/>
	Light microscope, phase contrast facility is recommended<br/>
	Laboratory cleaning detergent<br/>
	Ethanol (70 %)<br/>
	2 or 3 channel tally counter<br>
</p>	
	<p>
	Procedure
	<ol type="1">
		<li>
			Clean the counting chamber and coverslip sequentially with detergent, water and ethanol and dry thoroughly. wet the edges of the coverslip, lay it across the ruled counting area and press down firmly on to the supports oneither side.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add 10 <big>&micro;</big>l of cell suspension to 10 <big>&micro</big>l of eosin / trypan blue solution in a small tube (e.g 10 mm <big>&times;</big> 50 mm) Mix gently.
		</li>
		<li>
			Introduce the sample onto the ruled counting area under the cover slip. The space will fill by capillary action; 10 <big>&micro;</big>l is sufficient.
		</li>
		<li>
			Allow the cells to settle for 1 min and observe under the microscope (about 20 <big>&time;</big> objective). Erythrocytes are small clear cells; lympocytes are of similar size but opaque under phase contrtast; polymorphonuclear leucocytes are larger and opaque; platelets are small blsck dots; dead cells are red because eosin stains the nucleus.
		</li>
		<li>
			The improved Neubauer ruling consists of 25 large squares enclosed by triple lines, each of which is divided into 16 smaller squares. The volume encompassed by one large square to the height of the cover slip above the ruled area is 0.004m<sup>3</sup>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Count the number of lymphocytes and dead cells in five large squares (80 small squares) using the tally counter to record numbers. If the total is less than 100, count the number in the total counting area (25 large squares, 400 small squares). Cells are considered to be inside a square if they fall on the top or left perimeter line and outside if they are on the bottom or right.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cell concentration in origional suspension taken = number in five large squares <big>&times;</big> 10<sup>5</sup>/ml
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<pre>
<big>
Lympocyte viability = <u>(for any area)number of viable lymphocytes</u><big> &times; </big> 100%
			Sum of viable and dead lymphocytes
</big>
</pre>

<p>
	<em>Notes</em>
</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>
		0.1% erythrosin can be used instead of eosin; its colour is more easily seen by most people. Trypan blue is less visible than either of these reds and it is affected by any serum proteins present.		
	</li>
	<li>
		A mixture of 0.1mg/litre crystal violet in 10 % (v/v) acetic acid may be substituted for thr eosin solution. This lyses the cells to leave the nuclei so it cannot be used for viability. The shape of the nucleus is visible more clearly with this stain and so a better discrimination can be made between lympocytes, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and monocytes. However, erythrocytes are not detected in this solution.
	</li>
	<li>
		For aherent cells, a convenient assay of cell number is to apply the protein dye-binding technique to monolayers grown in multi-well plates after glutaraldehydefixation.
