MICROBIAL GROWTH & KINETICS IN BATCH CULTURE
	</big>
</pre>
</h2>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br/>
Studies of microbial growth can be conducted in  batch, feed-batch or continuous culture sytems.
In the batch system, the micro organism is inoculated in a closed system until the growth or fermatation process is completed without supplying any additional resources (e.g., oxygen, alkaline, base or food).  In a feed batch, there is controlled addition ofm one or more resources.  In both cases, there is accumulation of nproduts as there is no outflow.  In a continuous culture sytem, also known as  the chemostat, there is continous addition of resources required by the culture and there is an outflow of waste materials, which include toxic by-products and other metabolites. As bacteria grow, they consume nutrients in the form of organic carbon and nitrogen provided in the culture medium.  The micro organisms can be cultured on solid media (petridishes) or liquid media (shake flaskes and specialised bioreactors). In this experiment,  you will investigate the growth  of bacteria in batch culture.   

<b>Bacterial growth</b><br/>
Growth of bacteria in batch culture is initiated by the inoculation of viable cells into a sterile medium broth and requires optimum conditions of temperature, pH and aeration. The cells will reproduce rapidly and the dynamics of microbial growth can be graphed using a population growth curve, which is constructed by plotting the increase in cell numbers versus time of incubation. This grapgh can be used to del;ineate stages of the growth cycle (see Figure 1 below)
The stages of growth of bacteria can be divide into phases as follows
<p>
	The stages of the growth of bacteria can be divided into phases as follows:
</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>
		Lag phase
		<p>In this phase the cells are adjusting to the new environment.  There is a rapid biosynthesis of cellular macromolecules such as primary enzymes in predparation for the next phase.  The cells increase in  size but there is no cell division an d thus no in crease in  the cell numbers.
			
		
	</li>

	<li>
		Logarithmic phase
		<p>The cells reproduce at a rapid and uniform rate by binary fission.  There is a rapid exponedntial increase in population which doubles regularly until the maximum number of cells is reacheedddd.,  The time required for the population to double is known as the generation time.  The lenght of the log phase varies dependingon  a number of factors including type of organism land dthe composition of the medium.
			
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Stationary phase
		<p>The number of cells lundergoing divison is equal to the number of cells dying.  Thus there is no increase in cell numbers and the population is maintained at it s maximumlevel for a period.  The primaryh factors responsible for this phase are the depletion  of some essential nutriensts and accumulation  of toxic,  acidic or alkaline products.
			
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Decline or death phase
		<p>Micro-organisms die at a rapid and uniform rate due to the ddepletion of nutriesnts and build up of lmetabolic  waste.  In this experiment, you will monitor the changes in pHduring the frowth of bacteria.

	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Figure 1. Growth cycle of bacteria<br/>
	In the lag phase cells divide slowly as they adjust to their conditions. In the log phase cells reproduce rapidly and uniformly by binary fission. In the stationary phase there is no increase in cell numbers and in the decline phase cells start to die more rapidly than they are replication.
</p>

<p>
	The growth of bacteria over time can be measured indirectly or directky.
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			Indirectly using a spectrometer to measure the turbidity of the culture. Traditionally, the turbidity of the culture is defined as absorbance at 600nm (A<sub>600nm</sub>). This value can then be converted to a useful concentration value using the standard conversion factor where 1 OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 <big>&times;</big> 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml<sup>1</sup>
		</li>

		<li>
			Directly using a standard plate count where serial dilutions are used to plate out cells in order to calculate the number of colony forming units (CFUs) at a given time
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Pre-culture Preparation (prepared by technical staff)<br/>
	A single, pure colony of E. coli was inoculated into nnutrient broth (10 ml) and growm overnight in 50 ml tubes by incubating at 37 <sup>o</sup>C  and shaking at 250 rpm.  The pre-culture will be used as a seed to inoculate the experimental tubes in this study.

</p>

<p><b>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</b></p>

<P>Spectrophometry</P>

<p>
	Inoculation of tubes
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Make Make sure the spectrophotometer is et to 420 nm.  </li>
		<li>Zero the spectrophotometer using a sterile spectrophotometer tube containing nutrient broth only from  one of the water baths. </li>
		<li>Transfer 0.5 ml of E. coli pre-culture into each of 2 sterile spectrophotometer tubes containing 4 ml of LB broth from the 25<sup>0</sup>C water bath/.  Label your tubes! </li>
		<li>Repeat  for two tubes from the 37<sup>0</sup>C water bath. Label your tubes!</li>
		<li>Gently mix the contents of the inoculated msamples without  contaminating them and measure the absorbance of the samples in the spectrophotometer at 420 nm.  This is time point 0.
	 </li>
		<li>Return the tubes to their respective water baths at 25<sup>0</sup>C an 37<sup>0</sup>C </li>
		<li>Repeat the absorbance measurements every 20 min for 2.5 to 3 hours (until your measurements stop increasing).  Ensure that you mix the samples without contaminating them before taking the absorbance reading. </li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
Standard Plate Count<br/>
Each group will prepare and plate a set of serial dilution (figure 2) at 2 time points for each temperature condition at which the E. coli is growing.

</p>

<p>
	Prepare 4 sets of 3 test tubes containing sterile water as indicated in Gigure 2 below.  Make sure you label your test tubes.

	<ol type="1">
		<li>At time t=40 min, for one sample from the 25<sup>0</sup>C water bath and one sample from the 37<sup>0</sup>C water bath, after you have measured the absorbance of the sample, remove 0.1ml  of the bacterial culture from the tube and put it in the dilution tube labelled A and mix. </li>
		<li>Perform the rest of the serial dilutions as described in the diagram
		<img src="">
		Figure 2. Serial dilution and plating procedure</li>
		<li>Label four Petri dishes on the base (agar side) with your name, the time point that you sampled,  the temperature that you  sampled from and the dilution factor (10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>). </li>
		<li>Pipette 1 ml or 0.1 ml of the diluted bacterial cultures onto the correct petri dish as indicated in Figure 2. </li>
		<li>Spread the cullture using the method shown in Figure 3. Sterilize the spreader by dipping it into alcohol and then briefly flaming to burn off excess alcohol. Note:

		<ul type="circle">
			<li>The flame is not used to sterilise the spreader, alcohol is. The only reason you flame the spreader is to remove the alcohol once it is sterilised </li>
			<li>There may be some residual liquid on the spreader after you have flamed it. This water, not alcohol. Do not worry about removing ut. It is sterile.</li>
			<li>If you leave the spreader in the flame for too long, it will become too hot and you might kill the cells that you are trying to grow. </li>
			<li>Be sure to keep a safe distance between the dish and alcohol and the flame so you do not cause the alcohol to ignite in the dish. Never put a hot spreader into alcohol as it can ignite the alcohol </li>

		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Repeat this entire process at time t=120. </li>
		<li>The plates will be incubated agar side up at 37<sup>0</sup>C for 24-48 hours. </li>
		<li>After 24 hours check your plates.  only count the colonies on the plates with between 30 and 300 colonies per plate, discard the rest.  If more than one plate contains 30-300 CFUs average the numbers. </li>
