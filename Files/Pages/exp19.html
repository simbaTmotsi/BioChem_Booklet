PURIFICATION OF EGG WHITE LYSOZYME AND TESTING OF ENZYME ACTIVITY

	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>Preparation of Eggwhite Lysozyme</p>

Lysozyme (trivial name):  IUB 3.2.17

Systematic name: Mucopeptide N-acetylmuramyl hydrolase.

Lysozyme hydrolyses B-1,4-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and 2 acetamido--2-deoxy-D-glucose resides in mucopolysaccharides or mucopolysaccharides or mucopeptides of a variety of microorganisms.  Egg white, human ilk, tears, spleen and many other tissues including plant sources,, contain this enzyme.  Its antibiotic action is attributed to the ability to destroy invading bacteria by hydrolyzing the mucopolysaccharides of the cell wall.  The enzyme has been isolated in crystalline form, and the complete amino acid sequence was determined.  Lysozyme has a higher Isoelectric point (Ph10.5).  Than most proteins and this property will be used to purify it by ion exchange chromatography in this experiment.

Reagents

0.05 M Tris-FDTA containing 0.05M NaCl,pH 8.2 (Tri buffer)
0.2 M carbonate buffer, ph 10.5
CM- Sephadex 25 ion exchange resin equilibrated in Tri buffer
Biuret reagent:
Dissolve 9g potassium tatrate, 3g copper sulphate, 8g sodium hydroxide and 5g potassium iodide, in that order,  in distilled water.  Make up to 1L.
0.1M Phosphate nbuffer, pH 7.0
0.3 mg/ml ndried micrococuss lysodeikticus nin 0.1M Phosphate buffer, pH 7.0
5 mg/ml Eggs albumin

Preparation of enzyme:

A.	Packing the column

	Ion exchange chromatography will be used for the preparation of the enzyme.  The column should be made ready before commencing with the preparation of the enzyme.

	Vertically mount a 0.9x25 cm chromatography column.  Make sure that the bottom piece is assembled with a sintered glass wool plug and that the outlet spout has control for stopping flow out of column.  Weigh out 3.0g CM-Sephadex ion exchanger (1g swells to 4-6m) and allow to equilbrate for 48 hour (2 hours on a boiling water bath) in 0.05 M Tris EDTA -0.05 M NaCI buffer, pH 8.2.  Place slurry of this resin in a flask buffers degas, and pour it into the column, which should have buffer in it to level of 2-4 cm.  Allow resin to settle by gravity.  A height -to-diameter mratio of 10:1 gives good resolution.  After achieving a resin height of 15 cm, assemble the top end piece and attach a reservoir to the inlet  part.  Put some buffer in it qnd allow it to gravity feed the column at a flow rate of 2-5 ml/min so that it won't go dry.  Allow one bed volume of nbuffer to pass through the column.

B.	Prepartion of Enzyme

	Place a 10 x 10 cm square of a double layer of cheese cloth over a 100ml beaker.  Gently filter the white of an egg by stroking the balled cheesecloth against the side of the beaker.  Do not force the egg white through.  When more than one ml has been collected forn each student, proceed individually as follows:  Transfer 1 ml of the filtered egg white to a beaker.   Add 7 ml of 0.05 M TRIS buffer (a x 8 dilution), and pass this mixture though a large glass wool plug.  Centrifuge the filtered egg white buffer mixture for three minutes in a bench top centrifuge at top speed: 4 ml of supernatant will e used for the ion exchange purification.

	Carefully and slowly pour 4 ml of clear supernatant, (filtered, buffered egg white) around the side of top of the column without disturbing gel.  Save the rest of the supernatant for assay.  Allow sample to enter gel and start collecting the eluant immediately.  Contiuously was the column with TRIS buffer until 15 ml has been collected at a flow rate of 2-5 ml/min.  Once the column  has been set up, buffer should be continuously added, and at no time should be buffer head at the top of the column go below the resin.  Change the collecting vessel and continue eluting with Tris buffer until another 15 ml has been collected.  Now elute the column with 0.2 M carbonate buffer, pH 10.5 until two additional 15 ml aliquots have been collected.  When changing eluting buffer, carefully remove most of the firstbuffer from the top of the gel and place about a ml of second buffer and on the top of the gel and allow to enter the gel before topping up the column with second buffer and connecting to reservoir containing second buffer.  Keep all fractions at 4<sup>o</sup>C in ice bath until ready for assay, In order to save time, proceed to  the biuret and enzyme activity determination as each fraction is collected.

C.	Protein determination

	Biuret Method:  Determine the protein concentration of the nfiltered, buffered egg white and the four fractions, using samples as mshown in Table 1 (in duplicate).  The filtered buffered egg white solution is diluted 1 in 5 for this purpose and first TRIS eluate is diluted 1 in 2 in order for both to be in the appropriate range for biuretassay.  The remaining three eluates may be tested without dilution.  It must be remembered that the filtered and buffered egg white has been diluted 8-fold:  the second dilution of five fold brings the total dilution to 40 fold.  The concentration of filtered egg white will fall in a concenration range of 2 mg/ml since the original egg white has a concentration of about 80 mg/ml. In each determination the student should make sure that the absorbance readings are within the limits of the biuret determination.  If the sample proves to be too dilute, repeat the assay with undiluted eluate: if it appears too concentrated, dilute it to an aooropriate volume, and repeat the biuret determination.  Furthermore.  Since TRIS buffer interfered with the biuret determination by giving some colour of its own, the blank for TRIS fraction 2 should contain 2 ml  of undiluted buffer.  The blanks for carbonate fractions 3 and 4 should contain 2 ml of 0.2 M carbonate buffer.  The blank for the standards is distilled water.

	Do a standard curve for bovine serum albumin at 0.1.2.3 and 5 mg/ml.  Use the table below in the assay of both samples and standard.  Incubate the solutions for 10 minutes in a 37<sup>o</sup>C water bath.  Cool and read the absorbance at 540 nm.

Enzyme assay

Enzyme activity is also determined with diluted fractions.  The filtered buffered egg white should be diluted 10-fold and assayed.  Take 0.2 ml aliquot of the filtered buffered egg-white, which was saved and dilute it in to 2 ml.  The best dilutions for the TRIS and carbonate fractions may have to be ascertained.  Start with undiluted fractions.  These dilutions must be made with 0.1 M Phosphate buffer must be made with 0.1M Phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.
Lysozyme of egg white will hydrolyse bacterial cell walls.  The assay method is based on observing turbidometric changes of a suspension of dried cell walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus.  This is a specrophotometric assay in which the digestion or hydrolysis of the cell wall can be measured at 450 nm.  As hydrolysis takes place, the turbidity of  the cell wall suspension decreases.  This decrease is used to measure enzyme activity.  An abosorbance change of within 0.02 - 0.04 per minute is considred to be a good one for measuring activity.<u>One unit of activity is equal to an absorbance change of 0.001 per minute</u> at pH 7.0 and 25<sup>o</sup>C. The first two minutes of recorded change in absorbance are used to determine the rate of catalysis.

Suppose for example, one of your fractions had a concentration of 2 mg protein/ml.<br/>
It was diluted 1:10 for the enzyme assay, and 0.1ml exhibited an initial velocity of A + 0.030 min.Then,
<p>
<pre>
<big>
Units = 30/min
Total protein in the assay = <u> 2 mg/ml  &times; 0.1 ml </u> = 0.02 mg
					10

Specific activity =<u>   30  </u> = 1500 units/mg protein
		     0.02
</big>
</p>
</pre>
In order to accurately measure enzyme  activity it is very important to establish a dilution of enzyme that will give a reasonable rate of hydrolysis of absorbance change.  If the rate is not within the recommended limits cited above, then a furthern dilution of enzyme is necessary or the amount nof enzyme must be increased.  Undiluted fractions from 0.1 to 1.0 may be used in the later situation.  Whatever the case, be sure to record the dilution used in the assay, and note the original protein concentration of the fraction in order to property calculate activity.  In the actual assay itself, the substrate, a uniform suspension of 0.3mg/ml of dries micrococcus lysodeikticus also has been prepared in 0.1M Phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and kept at room temperature.

Set the spectrophotometer at 450 nm and zero absorbance with a water blank.  In all cases of assay add 0.1 ml of diluted or undiluted enzyme solution to 2.9 ml of substrate previously placed in a cuvette and mix.  Record immediately the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm at 15 second intervals for 4.5 minutes.  Make a few practice runs and attempt to get good duplication.
