		Title
	</h2>
	Although the practical exercise will have a title, you should prepare your own title that reflects what you did. The title should be short and informative making it easy for the reader to quickly understand the subject of the report. A title such as "Gluconeogenesis" is practically useless whereas "Formation of glucose from amino acid precursors by liver homogenates" is much more informative. If the title contains a scientific name, the name must be written out in full without abbreviation.
