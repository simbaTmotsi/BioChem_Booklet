<h2>
	Typed reports
</h2>
<p>
	If you choose to type your report, you should use a <em>serif</em> font of at least 12 point size. In addition to the Times New Roman fonrt that is the default font in Microsoft Word, other serif fonts include Garamond, Bookman Old Style and Century School book. The text should be double spaced and printed on only one side of the paper.
</p>
	<p>
		Although you may prepare tables using a computer, graphs should be drawn by hand. Most of the applications for preparing graphs that come with computers are not suitable for preparing graphs for scientific purposes. The ones that can be used require skills that take a long time to acquire. You are expected to write up your reports following the conventional format that is outlined below.
	</p>
		 All scientific reports are organised into a sequence of non-overlapping sections, each with its own heading. The format , with minor variations, is the one used by most scientific journals and you will need to become familiar with the styled and somewhat artificial method of writing. Typically a publication in a journal would include an abstract just before the introduction but you will not be writing abstracts for your reports and any acknowledgements will be optional.
