Experiment 1
		
USE OF PH METER
	</big>
</pre>
</h2>

<p>
Standard sodium hydroxide solutions can be used to titrate unknown solutions of strong acids (HCI) and weaks acids (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH). The endpoint of these titrations can be detected with a pH meter. The pH meter is an electronic instrument supplied with a special bulb which is sensitive to the hydrogen ions present in the solution being tested. The signal produced by the bulb is amplified and sent to a meter display.
</p>

<p>
When present in aqueous solution of pH 6.0, the predominant ionic species of a monocarboxylic, monobasic acid such as glycine, is doubly charged ion NH3CH200. This is a dipolar ion or 'zwitterion', which can behave as either an acid or a base. As alkali is added, it loses a proton, as an acid is added, it accepts a proton. Glycine differs from acetic acid in that an amino group replaces a hydrogen atom. The behaviour of thr molecule is however distinctly affected by the replacement, In this experiment, the pH meter will be used to study this behaviour by plotting and interpreting the titration curves for acetic acid and glycine.
</p>

Reagents

<p>
	Calibration buffers pH 4, pH 9 and pH 7
</p>

<p>
	0.2 N Hydrochloric acid
</p>

<p>
	0.2 N Sodium Hydroxide
</p>

<p>
	0.1 N Acetic acid
</p>

Procedure 

<p>
	Titration Curves for Acetic acid and Clycine
</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
		Standardise the pH meter at 7.0. Remove the electrode and insert it into exactly 20.00 ml of 0.1N acetic acid in a 50 ml beaker. Measure the pH. Add 1.00ml 0.2N sodium hydroxide from a burette. Mix with a glass rod and record the pH again Continue adding 1.00m; of alkali at a time and recording the pH until 11.00ml of sodium hydroxide have been added. Plot the number of milliequivalents of alkali added as an ordinate against the pH of the solution as the abscissa.
	</li>

	<li>
		Dissolve the required amount of glycine in 20.00ml of water to give 20.00ml of 0.1M solution. Proceed as above and titrate with 20ml of 0.2N sodium hydroxide. Prepare another solution and titrate with 11.00ml of 0.2N hydrochloric Acid. Plot your results together with those for (b) above on the same graph.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<b>Questions</b>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>What are the pK values of acetic acid and glycine?</li>
		<li>Indicate on your plot the regions of efficient buffering action for each compound.</li>
		<li>Explain the action of the amino group in affecting the pH of the neighbouring carboxyl group.</li>
		<li>Identify indicators that could be used instead of a pH meter for these titrations.</li>
