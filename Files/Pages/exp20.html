THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF BURIED AND EXPOSED THIOL GROUPS IN OVALBUMIN

	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

In proteins the relative position of the individual functional groups are clearly of importance to their chemical, physical and biological properties.  The side chain of amino acid residues in the interior of protein is, for example less likely to react with molecules in the solvent than are those o n the exterior of proteins.

A simple way of determining the distribution of functional groups in proteins is in terms of their relative reactivities to chemical reagents: surface groups would be expected to have reactivities similar to the same group in a simple peptide, while buried groups would be expected to have lower reactivities.  Other factors might cause deviations from this simple pattern,  but in general results from such chemicals modifications have been shown to correlate well with more precise techniques for localikzing variouus groups such as x-ray chrystallographic analysis.

Method

Thiol groups can be quantitatively determined by reaction with 5.5' dithiol (2 - nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) also known as Ellman's reagent.

<img src="">


The reaction is most favoured above pH 7.0.  The thionitrobenzoate anion liberated by the reaction has a strong yellow colour with an absorbance maximum at 412nm (&#892;) = 1.36 x 10<sup>4</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> at pH 8.0)

Reagents
<ol type="1">
	<li>Stock DTNB solution, 39.6 mg/10ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer ph 7.0. prepare fresh.</li>
	<li>Protein solution, 2mg/ml ovalbumin in 0.1 phosphate buffer pH 8.0. prepare fresh.</li>
	<li>Denaturing reagent, stock solution 10% w/v solution of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer npH 8.0</li>
	<li>Standard solution of cysteine (50g/ml) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer npH 8.0 prepare fresh from 1 mg/ml stock.</li>
	<li>Phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 8.0</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Preparation of protein samples</p>

		Prepare two sets of tubes in triplicate.  To the first set add 1.0ml of protein solution (2mg/ml ovalbumin) 1.0ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 8 and 0.5 ml of distilled water.  To the second set add 1.0 ml protein and 1.0 ml phosphate buffer followed by 0.5 ml of SDS (2% w/v).  Mix and leave at room temperature for about 2 min.  Prepare a blank for each set of tubes containing phosphate buffer (o;1 M pH 8.0) in place of the protein solution.

		Calculate the number of thiol groups in the "native" and 'denature' ovalbumin using the method given in 4 below</li>

	<li><p>Preparation of cysteine standards</p>

		Add 1 ml of cystein standard solution to 1.0ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 8.O. Make up to 2.5ml with distilled water.
		A calibration curve may be prepared by varying the volume of cysteine between 0-1.0 ml and making up the volume with phosphatem buffer.</li>


	<li><p>Effect of SDS on the availability of thiol groups in ovalbumin</p>
		
		Prepare a series of tubes (in duplicate) containing from 0-1.5ml of 0.1% SDS, where necessary making each tube up to 1.5ml with phosphate nbuffer.  Add 1.0 ml of protein solution to each tube, mix and leave at room temperature for 10 min before asaying for thiol groups as in (4) below.

		Plot moles  thiol/mole ovalbumin against final concen tration of SDS and comment on the results.</li>
	
	<li><p>Measurement of thiol groups</p>
	Dilute the stock DTNB solution 25 fold in phospate buffer pH 8.0. To each2.5 ml sample of protein (or cysteine standard) add 0.5 ml of diluted DTNB.
	Leave at room temperature for 5 minutes before measuring the absorbance at 412nm.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculations</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>First calculate the number of micromoles (&micro;moles) of thiol which react with DTNB in the 3ml reaction mixture.<br/>
	<sup>&#892;</sup>412 nm = 1.36 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> at pH 8.0

	<p>
		Where C is concentration in moles 1<sup>-1</sup>, A is absorbance and L = Length of light path in cms. 
	</p>

<p>
	&#892; = Acl<br/>
	Since L = 1 cm
</p>
	
	<pre>
	<big>
i.e concn (moles L<sup>-1</sup>)=  <u>     A    </u>
			1.36 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
	</big>
	</pre>

<p>Therefore number of &micro;moles 3 ml solution</p>

= <u>A &times; 10<sup>6</sup>&times;3        </u><br/>
&ensp;1.36&times;10<sup>4</sup>&times;10<sup>3</sup>

<p>
	=<u>A &times; 0.3<br></u>
	&ensp;1.36
</p>

	</li>

<li>
Secondly calculate number of micromoles of ovalbumin (M. wt. 45,000) in the 3 ml reaction mixture. When 1 ml of a 2 mg/ ml solution is used, the total amount of ovalbumin use is 2mg (2,000&micro;g) therefore <u>&micro;moles</u> ovalbumin
<pre>
<big>
	= <u> 2000 </u> = <u>0.044</u>
	  45,000
</big>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
	from above the number of moles of thiol per mole of ovalbumin

	<p><u>A&times;0.3</u><br>
	1.36	&ensp;<big>&#8725;</big> 0.044
