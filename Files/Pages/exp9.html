FACTORS AFFECTING SIZE OF DIGITAL FILES
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>
	<b> Introduction</b><br/>
	
	When you are working with digital images, the size of the foles is important for a vriety of reasons.<br/>
	Files occupy space on storage devices.  Although storage devices are becoming cheaper whole holding more information, it is still true that larger files occupy more space.  More space costs more money.<br/>
	Related to the occupation of space is the fact that large files can be difficult totransmit electronically.  The transmission may take an inordinately long time or even abort if the internet services are limited.<br/>
	The quality  of a digital image is an imporant factor that is influenced by the size of the file.  In general, the larger the file the greater the quality of the image.  Most cameras will produce ipeg files unless you specifically arrange for RAW files to be produced.  Starting with the file from the camerad, you can reduce the size  of the file for use in different situation.  One could keep the original for printing and use files of reduced size for transmission to colleagues.<br/>
	Whether an image is in colour or black and white influences the size of the file.  Coloured images are formed by combining information from three channels, the red, green and blue channels.  When the colour information is discarded, the black and white images that results is about one third the size of the coloured version. <br/>
	The problem with reducing the size of a digital file is that with increased reduction in size comes degradation of the image.  With excessive reduction of size, the file becomes essentially unprintable.<br/>
	You saw above that black wite image convered from coloured version s are smaller than their coloured parents.  One bit is required to carry the required information.  Coloured images may require 8 bits. 16 bits or 32 bits for the information that they vary.  Common bit depths and associated number colour levels are shown in the table below.

<p>Bit depths and their corresponding levels of tones or colours</p>

	<table style="border: none;">
		<tr style="border: none;"> <th style="border: none;"> Bit depth </th> <td style="border: none;"></td>   <th style="border: none"> Tones per channel per pixel</th> 	</tr>
		<tr style="border: none;">    <td style="border: none;"> 1  </td> 	<td style="border: none;"></td> 	            <td style="border: none;">   2   </td> 			</tr>
		<tr style="border: none;">	<td style="border: none;"> 8  </td>	<td style="border: none;"></td> 				<td style="border: none;">  256  </td>			</tr>
		<tr style="border: none;">	<td style="border: none;"> 16 </td>	<td style="border: none;"></td> 				<td style="border: none;"> 65532 </td>			</tr>
	</table>

	<p>In two otherwise identicla colour images, the image with higher bit depth will produce a larger file.</p>

	As you might expect, large digital files take more time to process than smaller ones.  When you are used to fast action of computers, the slowing down can be frustrating.  If a processing step normally takes one second, most people find it unacceptably long when the process takes ten seconds - even though ten seconds is really a very short time.<br/>
	You need to be careful indealing wikth black land white images.  If you scan a blackand white image with the scanner set for the colour mode, the scanner will treat theblack and white image as if it was a colour image and produce a large file.
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Colour mode<br/>
	Select an area of the picture to be scanned.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>	Scan the area in the Color mode and save the image as a high quality file with the name Colour scan.</li>
			<li>	Scan the same area in the Grayscale mode and save the image as a high quality file with the name Greyscale scan</li>
			<li>	Scan the same area in the Black and White mode and save the image as a high quality file with the name Black and White.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>	Size of image
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Scan the whole image and save the file as Original</li>
			<li>	Scan only  the sample lanes and save the file as Sample lanes.</li>
			<li>	Scan only the standard lanes and save the file as Standards.</li>
			</ol>
	</li>

	<li>	Resolution
			<ol type="a">
			<li>	Scan the sample lanes at a resolution of 300dpm and save the file as 300 dpm</li>
			<li>	Scan the sample lanes at 72dpm and save the file as 72 dpm</li>
			</ol>
	</li>

	<li>	Determination of te size of the files
			<ol type="a">
			<li>	Right click on the icon of each image</li>
			<li>	Click on Properties</li>
			<li>	You can now read off the size of each file</li>
			</ol>
	</li>
	</ol>
