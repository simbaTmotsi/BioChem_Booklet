You must help the reader extract information fromyour graphs and tables. Unless guided by you, reader will not bother to identify important trends in your results.
Results, figures and the like can never show anything. It is the investigator who does the showing.<br>
In the Discussion section you present any generalization that can be made from the results. Here you summerize your conclusion and present the evidence for arriving at the conclusions. The Didcuddion section is where you state wether or not the results you obtained agree with previous findings, which must be referenced.<br>
You must be careful not to make conclusions that are not supported by your results. Avoid the tendency to refer to values obtained as "correct" or "wrong". In science values are regarded not as "correct" but as "acceptable" under certain conditions. A change in measuring equipment or conditions may lead to new different acceptable value without any implication that the previous one was "wrong".<br>
You should avoid referring to an experiment as having succeded or failed. Although there are certain expectations when you perform an experiment, when your work is assessed, we are interested in establishing that you understood how the equipment worked, how the measurements that you made relate to theoretical principles, and thar you were thinking while you were working.
