	When presenting results,you must highlight any trends you want the reader to note. It is useful to identify graphs and tables by the data being displayed and by the figure number. For example ypu might write, "The dependence of absorbance at 280nm on the concentration of protein shown in Figure 3". Identify the figure by the data is evidence of a logical plan while identifying the data by a figure number makes it easy to locate the figure even when the figure is one of many.
	<h2>Recording the data</h2>
	When recording data, there are four issues that you need to attend to. Firstly always record the date on which the experiment was done. Secondly, you should record data promptly while the operations are being done. Thirdly, the data must be recorded in a notebook in a final form. It is not acceptable to record data on a scrap piece of paper with the intention of copying the information more neatly later. Finally, use indelible and waterproof ink for recording data. Pencils of whatever grade are not acceptable.<br/>
	One of the important decisions that you will have to make is to figure out how the raw results of a particular experiment will be recorded sensibly, then subsequent processing will be that much easier.Although most of your results will be recorded in tables, you need to plan carefully  about the specific tables to use. You will be assessed on your ability to design useful tables for the recording of results.Raw results that have been recorded in an experiment may be processed and used preparing figures is that <b>the reader should be able to understand the graph or table without reference to the surrounding text</b>. Graphs and tables are in effect miniature reports.
</p>
<h2>Units to use in graphs and tables</h2>
Below, are guidelines on how to show units in general and specifically when preparing graphs and tables.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Use only standard symbols or unit names.</li>
	<li>Avoid non-standard abbreviations such as cc or sec.</li>
	<li>Use the same symbols for singular and plural items, thus 25 cm not 25 cms.</li>
	<li>Do not mic information and symbols. Write "concentration of NaCl was 10g/l" and not 10 g of NaCl/l"</li>
	
	<li>Make clear what symbol belongs to what numerical value.
		<big>
	<pre>	The following representations are acceplable.
		10 cm <big>&times</big> 8 cm
		20<sup>o</sup>C to 30<sup>o</sup>C or (20 to 30)<sup>o</sup>C
		33 g <big>&plusmn</big> 3 g or (33 &plusmn 3) g
		55% <big>&plusmn</big> 6% or (55<big>&plusmn</big>6)%

	The following representations are not acceptable.
		10 <big>&times</big> 8cm
		20<sup>o</sup>C - 30<sup>o</sup>C or 20 to 30<sup>o</sup>C
		33 <big>&plusmn</big> 3 g
		55 <big>&plusmn</big> 6 %
	</pre>
		</big>
	</li>

	<li>You should not mix unit symbols and unit names.
	  <big>
	<pre>
	The following representations are acceptable.
		kg/m<sup>3</sup>
		kg m<sup>-3</sup>
		kilogram per cubic metre
	</pre>
	  </big>
	</li>

	<li>
		Old habits die hard.<br>
		In scientific reports the word "mass" has almost completely replaced the word "weight" and you should follow modern practice. However, when reporting dosages of drugs to be administered to an animal it is still acceptable to indicate the dosage as 20 mg/kg body weight. In modern practice we should write 0.2 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> but you still find 0.2M in many journals. Accordingly we will not be too strict in expecting you to follow modern practice.

</ol>

	 <button><h2>How to prepare graphs</h2></button>
	 Most of the text should appear in the legend and not on the graph itself. The only text on the graph should the labels on the two axes. The caption or legend is a description of what was plotted. Do not start a legend with "A graph to show..." or such similar expressions. Simply, briefly but comprehensively describe what is plotted .<br/>
	 When drawing  graphs, you should ensure that
	 <ol type="a">
	 	<li>the independent is on the horizontal axis</li>
	 	<li>the scales on each axis go up evenly bbut do not necessarily have to start at zero.</li>
	 	<li>the scale is adjusted such that the graph will fill atleast half of an A4 page</li>
	 	<li>both axes are labelled with the name of the variable and the appropriate units</li>
	 	<li>the intervals on both scales make it easy to make any calculations</li>
	 	<li>the points are plotted neatly with an X or a circled dot <big>&#8857</big>. </li>
	 </ol>
<p>
	Example of a graph in which points are joined with straight lines(Redrawn from results by C. Katayi (Chidewe) and M A N Benhura). The closed(<big>&#9679</big>) and open (<big>&#8857</big>)circles were shown in the caption as represented NaCl and KCl respectively.
</p>
	 <h2>How to prepare tables</h2>
	 Tables are the second method that is used to organize the information collected during research. Deciding how to present information in tables is an important aspect of doing research. You should design tables so that the reader can rapidly identify the results that were obtained. Sometimes it is helpful to nreak a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily.<br/>
	 Below is an example of a table that was modified from one appearing in a publication by Benhura and Marume(1993). The table was used to summarise the results obtained during the hydrolysis of a polysaccharide with acid.

	 <p>
	 <table style="width:80%" >
	 
	  <tr>
	   <th colspan="3"; >
	 	<b>Table 1.</b> Release of monosaccharide residues during autoclaving of solutions of <i>ruredzo</i> mucilage at 120<sup>o</sup>C or hydrolisis in 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
	   </th>
	  </tr>
	 
	 	
	 	<tr style="border: none">
			 	<th >
			 		Duration of treatmeant
			 	</th>
	 							<th colspan="2">
	 								Products that were detected after
															
										<tr>
											<td style="border-top: 2px solid grey"><b>hours</b></td> <td><b>Acid hydrolysis</b></td> <td style="border-left: 2px solid grey"><b>Autoclaving</b></td>
										</tr>
					 										
								</th>
	 	</tr>
	 	

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>1</td>	<td>None</td>	<td>Gal</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>2</td> <td>None</td> <td>Gal</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>3</td> <td>None</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>4</td> <td>Gal</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>6</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>10</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td> <td>Gal, Xyl, Ara, Mara, Unknown 1 and Unknown 2</td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td>20</td> <td>Gal and Xyl</td> <td></td>
	 	</tr>

	 	<tr>
	 		<td style="padding: 6px"></td><td></td><td></td>
	 	</tr>

	 </table>
	 </p>

The table below is an example of a standard curve. Standard curves are widely used in biochemistry and you should low to organize data required for the plotting of a standard curve effectively.<br>

<p>here place graph 2</p>
<img src="">
<p>here place graph 3</p>

<p>Example of an accepted table</p>
When you present your results, it is not good enough to simply give a catalogue of graphs and tables. You must provide pointers to any trends that may be observed. You need to guide your reader through your results. If your results are presented in an ordered manner, you will find that writing the corresponding discussion is much easier.
