EFFECT OF SUBSTRATE CONCENTRATION ON ENZYME KINETICS: 
DETERMINATION OF K<sub>M</sub> AND V<sub>MAX</sub> FOR AN ENZYME

	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

Objectives:
To analyze the effect of substrate concentration on the activity of enzyme.

Theory:


Enzymes are protein molecule that acts as biological catalysts.  They increase the rate of ractions without changing of the overall process.  They are long chains of amino acids bound together by peptide bonds.  They are seen in all living cells and controlling the metabolic processes in which they converted nutrients into energy and new cells.  Enzymes also help in the breakdown of food materials into its simplest form.  The reactants of enzyme catalyzed reactions are termed substrates and each enzyme is quite specific in character, acting on  a particular substrates to produce a particular products.  The central approach for studying the mechanism of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is to determine the rate of the reaction and its changes in response with the changes in parameters such as substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, pH temperature etc.  This is known as enzyme kinetics.  One of the important parameter affecting the rate of an reaction catalyzed by an enzyme is the substrate concentration,(S)/  However, studying the effects of substrate concentration is elaborated by the fact that during the course of an in vitro reaction.  (S) changes due  to the conversion of substrate to product.  One simplest method to study enzyme kinetics is to measure the intial rate of the reaction designated V<sub>o</sub> (Initial velocity) when (S) is much greater than the concentration of enzyme.  (E).  The effect on V<sub>o</sub>. when the enzyme concentration becomes constant is shown in Figure (1).

Michaellis - Menten Equation

Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten postulated that the enzyme first combines reversibly with its substrate to form an enzyme-substrate complex in a relatively fast reversible step:

<img src="">

In the next step, this ES complex is breaks down in to the free enzyme and the reaction product P:


<img src="">


Since the second step is the rate limiting step, the rate of overall reaction must be proportional to the concentration of the ES that reacts in the second step.  The relationship between substrate concentration, (S)  and Initial velocity of enzyme, VO (Fig. 1) has the same general shape for most enzymes (it approaches a rectangular hyperbola).   This can be expressed algebraically by the Michaelis-Menten equation.  Based on their basic hypothesis that the rate limiting step in enzymatic reactions is the breakdown of the ES complex to free enzyme and product.  Michaelis and Menten derived an equation which is:


<img src="">

The necessary terms in this reaction are (S). VO. Vmax, and Km (Michaelis constant).  All these terms can be measured experimentally.

Lineweaver - Burke plot

In 1934, Lineweaver and Burke made a simple mathematical alteration in the process by plotting a double inverse of substrate concentration and reaction rate.


<img src="">

For enzymes obeying nthe Michaelis-Menten relationship, the "double reciprocal" of the VO versus (S) from the first graph, (fig 1) yields a straight line (Fig 2).  The slope of nthis straight line is KM /Vmax, which has an intercept of 1/Vmax on the 1/VO axis, and an intercept of -1/KM on the n1/(S) axis.  The double-reciprocal presentation, also called a Lineweaver-Burk plot.  The main advantage of Lineweaver-burk plot is to determine the Vmax more accurately, which can only be approximatedm from a simple graph of VO versus (S) (Fig 1).

Principal:

The enzyme a Amylase can catalyze the hydrolysis of internal a -1,4-glycosidic bond present in starch with the production of reducing sugars.  In the study of substrate concentration on enzyme kinetics, the enzyme is kept constant where as sthe concentration of Starch is taken in increasing order.  As the substrate con centratikon increase, the amount of products produced in every successive tube also increases.  This was explained by Michealis and others that an enzyme catalyzed reaction at  varying substrate concentrations is diphasic i.e at low substrate concentration the active sites on molecules (enzyme) are not occupied by substrate an d the enzyme rate varies with substrate molecules concentratikon (phase 1).  As the number of substrate molecules increases, the enzyme attains the saturation level, since there is no more reaction sites remaining for binding.  So the enzyme can work with full capacity and its reaction rate is independent of substrate concentration. (Phase II).

This Enzyme - substrate reaction can be determined by measuring the increase in reducing sugars using the 3.5 Dinitro salycilic acid reagent.  In an alkaline condition, the pale yellow colored the 3,5- dinitro salicylic acid undergo reduction to yield orange colored 3- amino -5-nitrosalicylic acid.  The absorbance of resultant solution is read at 540nm.  The intensity of color depends on the concentration of reducing sugars produced.
