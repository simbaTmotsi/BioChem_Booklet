<P>
<b>A. BACTERIA</b>
</P>

<P>
	Bacteria are a group of single-celled microorganisms that, along with the Archaea, are classified as prokaryotes. Prokaryotic cells are structurally much simpler than euksryotic cells brcause they have no internal membrane-bound organelles (i.e. no mitochondria, no chloroplasts, no Golgi, no nucleus, etc.). Most prokaryotic cells are also much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Atypical bacterial cell is about 1 micrometer (1 <big>&micro;</big>)m indiameter, while eukaryotic cells range from 10 to 100 <big>&micro;</big>m in diameter. This means that eukaryotic cells have between 1,000 and 1,000,000 times the <em>volume</em> of prokaryotic cells.
</P>
single bacterial cells are too small to be seen without a microscope, because of this people do not realize that they are most abundant form of life on the planet, both in terms of biomass and total numbers of species. Bacteria and other prokaryotes are found in every environment on the planet, including all of the habitats where eukaryotes live, but also in environments considered too extreme or inhospitable for eukaryotic cells/organisms - such as boiling water or ice. Thus, the outer limits of life on Earth (hottest, coldest, driest, etc.) are usually defined by the existence of prokaryotes. Many people associate bacteria with illness, but less than 1% of all known bacterial species are capable of inducing disease. The vast majority of bacterial species are free-living (non-disease causing) and many bacteria from symbiotic relationships with plants and animals that usually benefit both organisms. The lives of plants and animals are dependent upon the activities of bacterial cells. For plants, bacteria help maintain the pH of the soil and provide important nutrients. In animals, including humans, skin and mucous membranes are habitats for 500-1000 different species of bacteria and the total number of bacteria exceeds the number of cells in all the tissues and organs which comprise a human. In this practical, you will be sampling multiple environments for different species of bacteria and visualizing the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells under the microscope.
<p>
	<b>B. CULTURING BACTERIA ON AGAR PLATES</b>
</p>
<p>
	Before the work of Robert Koch (1843-1910), it was impossible to isolate pure cultures of bacteria. Koch was studying the transmission of beacteria-borne diseases but he could never grow a pure culture of any bacterial type. Every time he tried to isolate and grow up one type  of bacteria it always resulted in a mixture of bacteria cell types. He knew this because he could see differences in the appearance and size of the cells using a light microscope, similar to the ones you will be using today. One day, Koch boiled a potato, cut in half, and accidentally left the potato out of his kitchen counter overnight. In the morning, he was amazed to see small "colonies" of different colors and shapes (morphologies) and immediately realized thatbacteria from the air had landed on the sterile potato surface during the night and had begun to divide. Each colony represented a clonal population derived from a single cell that had landed on the potato's surface. Koch was delighted to see that when he placed a colony in some sterile media and then viewed it under the light microscope, all the bacterial cells had the same appearance.
</p>

<p>
	Koch's discovert of how to grow up pure cultures of different bacteria eventually led to the development of the ideal medium for promoting such growth: agar. Agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell membranes of some species of red algae or seaweed, and it cannot be digested (liquified) by bacteria. It provides an ideal surface for bacterial cell growth (cell division). Bacterial cell division rates are very fast in comparison to eukaryotic organisms. Many bacterial species can undergo cell division every 20 minutes. Thus, in 8 hours, a single bacterial cell can give rise to a population of millions of cells, which cluster together as a colony visible to the naked eye. An average colony may be composed of between 300,000-5,000,000 identical cells. Colonies of different species will have different observable or <i>phenotypic </i> characteristics, including size, shape, height, texture and color. These are collectively known as the colony morphology of the species grown on an agar plate. The different colony morphologies (phenotypes) are the result of the different genetic makeup of each individual species. In this practical, you should be able to observe the colony morphology of bacteria collected from diffrerent environments.
</p>

<p>
	<b>C. ORAL BACTERIA</b>
</p>

<p>
	The human body provides many excellent habitats for bacteria. The human body has a stable temperature, high moisture content, and certain areas, such as the mouth, represent a large food resource. It is estimated that 1 quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) bacteria comprised of 500 to 1000 different species live in and on us (in comparison to the 100 trillion cells that make up an individual human). Bacterial species that are expected to be present under normal circumstances, and do not cause disease, are termed normal flora. To observe bacterial species of the human mouth, you will both culture and stain cheek and gum samples. A simple staining procedure will allow you to distinguish prokaryotic cells from cheek cells. Bacterial species that inhabit the human mouth are able to attach to epithelial cells of the cheek (buccal cells), the gums, as well as the teeth. The buccal cells have about 20 times the diameter of the oral bacterial cells, making it easy to distinguish between them under the light microscope.<br/>

	</li>
</ul>

<b>
	EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES<br/>
	PART A. MEDIA PREPARATION<br/>
</b>
The technical staff will give you a demonstration on the preparation and sterilization of media. They will also demonstrate sterile technique, the method used when working with bacteria to ensure the growth of pure colonies without contamination.
<ul type="circle">
	<li>In your write-up, briefly describe the nutrients present in media that are required for growth and the purposes of the auto clave and sterile flow hood.</li>
</ul>

<b>PART B. CULTURING BACTERIA FROM THE ENVIRONMENT</b><br/>
<ol type="1">
<li>
	You will be given 2-3 agar plates per group. Choose 2-3 environment sources of interest that you would like to sample. For example, it might be interesting to swab your hands before and then after hand washing ans compare the results. What other types of environmental sources could you test and compare? You MUST come up with your <em>own</em> idea (no one can choose the before and after hand washing idea)!
</li>	
<li>
	Using a marker, write your group name and sample source on the agar side of the plate (not the lid).
</li>
<li>
	To sample an environment source, moisten a cotton wool bud with the sterile water. Press out any excess water in the swab on the inside of the tube of sterilw water. The cotton wool should be moist but not dripping with water then gently swipe the cotton wool bud several times across the surface. Do not press too hard on the agar, you do not want to break the surface of the agar plate. Use a clean cotton wool bud for each sample.
</li>
<li>
	Place the plates LID SIDE DOWN on the tray at the front of the class for incubation for 24 hours. (Placing the plates lid side down ensures that any condensation that may form on the lid during incubation does not drip down onto the agar.) Your plates will be incubated at room temperature (approximately 22 <sup>o</sup>C).
</li>
<li>Discard the cotton wool buds in the bin.</li>
<li>After 24 hours observe your plates. Make a record of what you see and discuss this in your write up.</li>
</ol>

<b>PART C. VIEWING CHEEK CELLS AND ORAL BACTERIA BY MICROSCOPY</b><br/>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Using a black grease pen or marker, draw a circle on your slide (as shown below)<br/> <big><big>&#9645;</big></big></li>
	<li>Choose a volunteer in your group to wipe the gum line or cheek of the inside of their mouth with a cotton wool bud. Apply the collected material to the circle. Discard the used cotton wool bud in the bin.
	</li>
	<li>
		Allow the slide to completely air dry. Then, holding the slide with the forceps (not your fingers!), quickly pass the slide through the flame of a Bunsen burner three times. <b>DO NOT LEAVE THE SLIDE IN THE FLAME FOR MORE THAN 2 SECONDS AT A TIME!!</b> This procedure will "heat fix" the cells to the slide so they do not wash off when dye and water are applied to the slide.
	</li>
	<li>
		Still holding the slide with the forceps, take the slide to one of the lab sinks and add a drop of crystal violet stain to the circle. Let the dye sit for 1 minute and then thoroughly rinse the slide with water from a water bottle. This step MUST be done at the sink! Crystal violet stains clothing <b><em>permanently</em></b>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lightly pat the slide dry with a tissue.
	</li>
	<li>
		Observe your slide, using both the 10<big>&times;</big> and 40<big>&times;</big> objective lenses (see notes on microscope use below). Bacteria will be seen as small, darkly staining spheres or rod shapes on the surface of the buccal (epithelial cheek) cells.
		<ul>
			<b><em>Ask your lecturer or TA if you are unable to get a good view of the cells on your slide.</em></b>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		For 5 different cheek cells on your slide, count the number of bacterial cells that are attached and record your results in your lab notebook. Then calculate the average number of bacteria per cheek cell, writing out your calculation in your notebook.
	</li>
	<li>
		Also in your notebook, draw what you see on your slide. Record the shapes and relative sizes of the bacterial and cheek/buccal cells.
	</li>
	<li>
		Estimate how many bacterial cells could line up end-to-end across the diameter and buccal cell. Then calculate the volume difference between a buccal cell and an oral bacterial cell.
	</li>
</ol>

Using the microscope to observe bacteria<br/>
A good approach to observing any smear of very minute objects is to examine it under low power (40<big>&times;</big>) in bright field first to become oriented.<br/>
After focusing, work up to 100<big>&times;</big>, 400<big>&times;</big>, and finally oil immersion (1000<big>&times;</big>).<br/>
The immersion oil is placed directly on the smear.

<p>
	At low magnifications stained material looks like dirt on the slide. Higher magnifications are needed in order to se any detail. Bright field oil immersion microscopy is necessary to see an undistorted image of any directly stained bacterial smear. After putting immersion oil on a slide, the high dry (40<big>&times;</big>) lens cant't be used again unless the oil is removed.
