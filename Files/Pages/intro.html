<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	<h1>
		<b>The purpose of any writing is to influence the reader</b>
	</h1>
</p>

<p>
	Without the writing of reports, there can be no science. No matter how important an experiment may be and no matter how well the experiment may have been designed and executed, all will come to waste if what was done and the results that were obtained are not reported effectively. Scientific jobs are found and lost on the basis of ability or otherwise to communicate. While the manipulation of pieces of apparatus is a major activity of scientists. Only by preparing reports can you make people aware of your effort. If you want to be an effective practising scientist. You will need to develop robust communication skills.
</p>

<p>
	During your training in the department you will be expected to develop two essential skills that are necessary for working as a biochemist. First you will need to learn to the collection of data. Secondly, you will need to learn about how results of a scientific study are presented. Although we will introduce you to various pieces of equipment and procedures, we cannot overemphasize the idea that the fundamental skills that you must acquire relate to the collection of data and effective presentation of results.
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		General requirements
	</h2>
	At present we expect that most reports will be hand written. You should ensure that your reports are prepared neatly and that all words are legible. A simple fact that many students seem to be unaware of is that you cannot get credit for what the one is marking your work cannot read.
	Present your material in a logical manner so that the reader can follow your presentation easily. Your writing should be broken up into suitable paragraphs. Each paragraph should deal with only one main idea. Consider a paragraph as a unit of thought. Typically a paragraph will contain key sentence that will be supported by the other sentences in the paragraph. A sentence should deal with one idea only. you should say one thing at a time.
	You can test wether or not you are presenting information effectively. If you can summarize the content of a paragraph in one sentence you are doing things right. If not you need more paragraphs
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		Version of English
	</h2>
	Throughout your study with us, you should use the Zimbabwe version of English. which is almost indistinguishable from the origional British English. Do not use American English in which, for example, colour is not spelt color, centre as center, plough as plow. Words like hemoglobin or anemia are not Zimbabwean English.
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		Buy a dictionary
	</h2>
	You will not be able to write effectively unless you get into the habit of checking information in dictionaries. You are strongly advised to buy a dictionary. Because dictionaries differ in the usefulness, you should choose the one to buy carefully.
</p>

<p>
	In the introduction you should address three issues that will help the reader to understand what you report. 
	<ul>
		<p>
		<li>Fistly you need a clear statement of what you are investigating and why the subject is releveant or interesing. </li>
		</p>
		<li>Secondly you need to provide information on what is already known on the subject you are investigating. The information may concern the methods that you will use for measurements or the materials and organisms and tissues that will be manipulated.
			<p>
			Having placed the subject in context, you need to explain how you approached the problems. There usually several ways of dealing with problems and you need to indicate how you adopted a certain approach. Here you can define the scope of what you did
			</p>
		<li>Finally somewhere near the last sentence of the last paragraph of the introduction, you should make a clear statement of what you set out to do. 
			<p>
				Indeed, you make the statement the first sentence of the introduction itself. The statement of the objective of a study is one of the most important sentences in a report and must be crafted very carefully. You should, therefore pay special attention to what you set out to do. Reports are judged on the basis of how well the stated objectives are achieved.
			</p>
		</li>
	</p>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		Materials and methods
	</h2>
	The materials and methods section of a report includes a description of what was done including how the data was collected, materials used and the conditions under which measurements were made.
	In a proper scientific paper, the Materials and methods section should include enough detail for someone working in a similar area to repeate the measurements. In your class reports, you should state what you did as succinctly as possible without including details of procedures. Use the past tense to avoid the personal "l" or "we". Where the experimental activity was done in sections, each section must be summarized. The ability to extract releveant information and prepare a summary is one of the signs that you understood what you were doing. You can then refer to the laboratory manual.
	when referring pieces of equipment such as spectrophotometersm pH meters or centrifuges. You should refer to the actual make of the equipment. Measurements should be described in roughly the same order in which the measurements were made.
	You should not present your description of procedures as instructions such as "Place test tubes in a water bath..."
</p>

<p>
	<h2>
		Results
	</h2>
	The results section of a report typically contains three types of information, graphs, tables, and pictures. Of the three types of results, you will be concerned with only graphs, and tables during the class exercises.
	The Results section is extremely important because here you provide the evidence for whatever conclusions that you will make. The results must be presented in a manner that helps you to persuade the reader toarrive at the same conclusion as a way  of deciding usefulness of a dictionary is to look up how the word "asprin" is defined. If the definition uses words that must be looked up again, do not buy the dictionary.
	<p>
		I recommend the latest version of the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary. In addition to the usual definitions, the dictionary has sections on how to prepare reports and make presentations. Do yourself a favour and acquire a copy. A good dictionary is once of the most effective tools of practicing biochemist.
