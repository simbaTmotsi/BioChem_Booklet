NORMAL DISTRIBUTION AND STANDARD DEVIATION
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>
Statistics, as reflected in the word, was originally concerned with affairs of state. At present, however, statistics is used in the planning of experiments and analysing of results in most scientific areas including biochemistry.<br/>
Statistics is based on the laws of chance or probability and deals with events that occur at random. The random  occurrence of an event is not influenced by outside factors.
</p>
<p>
In the fields of agriculture and epidemiology, investigators take rigorous formal  steps to ensure randomomness. In biochemistry, we do not normalolly carry out formal steps of randomization.
</p>
Origionally developed from the work of Abraham Demoivre and Pierre Laplace, the idea of normal distribution is most commonly associated with Kar; Frederic Gauss.Indeed normal distribution is commonly referred to as Gaussian distribution.<br/>
When plotting a normal distribution, the observations are shown on the X axis. The values for each observation are  shown on the Y axis.

<img src="">

The normal distribution, which is illustrated above has a number of properties that you should be aware of.
<ol type="a">
<li>  Firstly, the curve is bell shaped</li>
<li>  Secondly, the curve is symmetrical so that the, mean, media and mode are the same.</li>
<li>  Thirdly, the curve extends infinitely on both sides of the mean.</li>
<li>  Fourthly, the area under the curve is 1 or 100%</li>
<li>  Fifthly, most of the scores are close to the mean and the further away we go from the mean the fewer the scores we encounter.</li>
<li>  Finally, and importantly for scientific investigators, 99.7% of the scores lie wothin three deviations of the mean.</li>
</ol>

The Gaussian distribution is represented by the scary equation below.

<pre>
	<big>
f<sub>(x)</sub> =<u>    1  </u> <big> e </big> <big><sup><u>-(x - &micro;)2</u></sup></big>
       <big>&sigma;</big>&radic;(2<big>&pi;</big>)	     <big><sup><sup>2<big>&sigma;</big><sup>2</sup></sup></sup></big>
</big>
</pre>

<p>
	Although the equation looks intimidating, what you should appreciate is that in the equation the relationship between the standard deviation and mean is shown.
</p>

<p>
	Confusingly, the Gaussian distribution is often referred to as Normal distribution. You should be clear in your mind that the word normal is used in different senses. Statisticians use the word normal to mean Gaussian. In contrast, most scientists use normal to mean commonly found. Medical doctors use normal to mean not associated with disease. For example, a normal blood pressure is one that does not predispose you to a stroke. Therefore, whenever you see the word normal in a technical publication, take a minute to establish exactly which of the meanings applies.<br/>
	The normal distribution is the most ubiquitous distribution used in science and often provides a useful approximation when what is being studied is not normally distributed.<br/>
	In biochemistry we usually assume normal distribution. The practice is partly based on the central limit theorem, which states that things that are of many small effects tend to follow normal distribution . For example, the colours whose absorbance we measure on a spectrophotometrer depend on the substance being measured, the temperature, any minerals that might be present, the concentration of gases such as oxygen and the duration of the reaction.
</p>

<p>
	What you will be working with<br/>
	You are provided with 100 maize kernels that have been taken more or less randomly from bulk container.
</p>

<p>
	Before you actually start<br/>
	Study the whole practical exercise carefully, You then need to plan how you are going to record the results.
</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>
		Normal distribution
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Weigh each of the kernels on an analytical balance.</li>
				<li>Identify the highest and lowest masses in your measurements and divide the difference between the two into seven intervals.</li>
				<li>Count and record the masses that fall into each of the seven intervals.</li>
				<li>Plot a graph of the number of entries in each interval on the Y  axis against the intervals on the X axid. Use the MIDDLE of the interval for the X axis.</li>
			</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Standard deviation for 10 kernels
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Replace the maize kernels that you used in step 1 into the origional container.</li>
				<li>With your eyes closed pick ten kernels from the container.</li>
				<li>Weigh the ten kernels.</li>
				<li>Calculate the mean mass, <big>&micro;</big>, of the ten kernels.</li>
				<li>Calculate the standard deviation, <big>&sigma;</big></li>, for your result
			</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Standard deviation for 5, 3 and 2 kernels
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Repeat the procedures in step 2 for 5, 3 and 2 kernels</li>
			</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
		Calculations
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
				Using the mean and standard deviation values from step 2 calcutate <big>&micro;</big>+<big>&sigma;</big> and <big>&micro;</big>-<big>&sigma;</big>
				</li>

				<li>
					Using the values obtained in step 1, count the number of kernels with a mass equal to or greater than <big>&micro;</big>-<big>&sigma;</big> but less than or equal to <big>&micro;</big>+<big>&sigma;</big>
				</li>

				<li>
					Express the value obtained in 4, b as a percentage of the total number of kernels
				</li>
			</ol>

		<p>
			Writing up your report
		</p>

		<p>
			An important aspect of scientific research is that results should be summarized in a manner that makes it easy for readers to understand what was done and to analyze the results for themselves.<br/>
			Before writing up the report, please make sure that you have read the Guidelines for Preparing Practical Reports in the Department of Biochemistry
		</p>

		<p>
			Your report should not be more than 1000 words long. Indicate the actual number of words as the very last item in your report
