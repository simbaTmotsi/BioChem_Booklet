LIPIDS ANALYSIS BY THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>
	lipids represent a very wide range of differnt molecular weights, solubilities, polarities and structures. Most but not all, of these compounds are either ester or total lipd extraction high polarity solvents are required. Chloroform-methanol solvent mixtures provide the necessary solvent polarity which is very efficient for total lipid extraction.
</p>

<p>
	it is not possible to achieve complete separation of these complex mixtures of lipid compounds utilising one separation method.  However, chromatographic methods provide relatively simple techniques to separate these mixtures  into their constituent classes, groupds and subgroups, which are less complex mixtures.  Thin layer  chromatography with silica gel and silica gel-modified adsorbants can be used to avhieve good preparative and analytical separations of these lipid classes and groups.  As silica gel is a polar absorbent, increasingly polar mobile solvents are used to mobilise the lipids with a higher degree of polarity such as the phospholipids.  This chromatographic  separation that is achieved is called. "developing the plates".

</p>

<p>
	MATERIALS:
	<p>

		2. Silica gel H or G thin layer plates<br/>
		3. 0.25mm thick on 5 cm <big>&times;</big> 20 cm glass plates, activated before use by heating to 110<sup>o</sup>C for 30 min and cooled in a dessicator
	</p>
</p>

<p>N.B</p>
<p>
Each group/person reuires one plain silica gel plate and one impregnated with 2% ammonium sulphate.  Glass capillaries are drawn for sample application if microlitre syringes are not available.  Small volume homogenisers are preferred, therefore individuals can prepare their own material for extraction. 

</p>
 
<p>The following solvent mixtures are required for analysis.</p> 

Developing solvents for thin layer chromatography:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Low polarity solvent:  hexane-diethyl ether-acetic acid (80:20:1, v/vO) </li>
	<li>Intermediate polarity: CHCI<sub>3</sub> - MeOH-H<sub>2</sub>O- acetic acid (35:10:1:1, v/v)<br/>
	Spray reagents for visualisation:
	<ol type="1">
		<li><big>&alpha;</big> - Napthol reagent:<br/>
		0.5g <big>&alpha;</big> - Napthol (re-crystallised from hexane-chloroform) in 100ml of methanol- &emsp;water (1:1, v/v)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Resorcinol reagent:
	<p>
		2g of resorcinol in 100ml water, this is a stable solution and can be kept for further use.  At least 4 hrs before use, add 10ml of this solution and can be kept for further use.  At least 4 hrs before use, add m10ml mof this solution to 80ml  conc. HCI (Analar). containing 0.5ml of 0.1m copper sulphate (2.5 g CuSO4.5H2O in 100ml water).  Then dilute this solution to 100ml with water.

	</p>
	<p>
		For general visualisatoin use a closed container saturatedm with iodine vapour due to presence of iodine crystals.  Keep in a fume cupboard.
		(An alternate method is to spray the developed plate with a sulphuric acid solution (55% by weight)containing 0.6% potassium dischromate.  EXTREME CARE is required.  Then heat plate in an oven at 150<sub>o</sub>C and lipid components will appear as black spots on a light grey background, with steroids having am more reddish-purple colour)

	</p>
	</li>

	<li>Standards
	<p>
		Fatty Acids &emsp; - &emsp; Stearate, Oleic acid,<br/>
		Glycolips &emsp; - &emsp; Cholesterol, sulphatides, glycosyl, di-glycerides, gangliocides, cerebrocides<br/>
		Trigycerides- Tripalmitin, Triaglycerol<br/>
		Standars should be made up in an appropriate solvent, at sufficient concentration only to give visual spots when used with the correct reagent.
	</p>
	</ol>

<p>
	<b>B. SEPARATION OF LIPID CLASSES BY TLC:</b><br/>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Activate the plain silica gel H TLC plates before use at 110<sub>o</sub>C for 30min and cool in a dessicator.  </li>
		<li>Apply a few drops of vegetable oil provided (about 5 ul) on a baseline about 2cm from the bottom of the plate, along with other spots of lipid standards, if available. </li>
		<li>Develop the plate in the low polarity solvent, ensuring that mthe baseline lies above the level of the solvent.  The sides of the developing tank should be lined with filter paper to ensure vapour saturation in the tank.  </li>
		<li>Mark the position of the solvent front after development, then allow the platesm to dry in a fume cupboard before visualization in the iodine vapour tank.  Note the position of the brown spots mappear. </li>
	</ol>
</p>


<p>
	<b>A.SEPARATION OF GLYCOLIPIDS BY TLC:</b><br/>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Use the plates prepared with silica gel G or H containing 2% ammonium sulphate. Apply the samples as before, but in duplicate on two haves of the plate, to allow for differential visualisation. </li>
		<li>Develop the plate in the intermediate polarity solvent system.  Mark the final solvent front and place in a fume cupboard to dry. </li>
		<li>Cover half the plate with aluminium  foil or a clean glass plate and spray with a-naphthol reagent.  Then spray lightly with 95% sulphuric acide, and cover this half and spray the other half with resorcinol reagent.  Heat the plate nin an oven  at about 120<sub>o</sub>C until  maximum colour is developed.  </li>
		<li>The a-naphthol reagent detects glycolipids (cerebroside, gangliosides, sulphatides, glycosyl diglycerides etc) giving purple-blue spots. Other polar lipids give yellow spots.  but cholesterol gives a grey-red spot.  The resorcinol reagent gives blue-violet nspots with gangliosides and sialic acid derivates.
