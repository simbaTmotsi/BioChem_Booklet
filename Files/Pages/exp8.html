SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>
	All scientificactivity is ultimately based on measujrements of one sort or other.  Measurements, provide the the tools with which we can convince outsiders about what we have come to believe.  If, for example, you suspect that adding a substance x to the soil will promote the growth of maize plants, you must make measurements that will provide evidence that what you suspect is indeed the case.  How strong the evidenc is will depend on the reliability of your measurements.
	In common with other scientific investigators, biochemists frequently have to measure lenght, mass, volume and absorbanced of various items or substances in order to make conclusion about the properties of the materials being studied.
	In the fields of epidemiology, agriculture and decology additional measurements of area and the number of people or plansts are often made.
	When using a certain piece of equipment, there is always a set of numbers that can be read off the scale with any problems.  In analogue equipment,  it si rare to have the pointer point to a mark division on the scale.  Usually one has to estimate the last uncertain figure.  In the diagram below, the measujrement of an object using a meter rule is shjown.  Only the parts of the ruler and object near the position we are interested in have been shown.  Most people would agree that the object is more than 10.4 cm but shorter than 10.5 cm.  Whether the object is 10.42cm, 10.43 or 10.45 cm is more diffucult to agree on.  In practice, each individual worker makes up their own mind as to what should be reported.


	<img src="">
	A metre rule whose smallest divisions are millimetres is being used to determine the length of an object.
</p>
<p>
	In the example above.  I would say that the pieeowas 10.43 cm long. Once a decision has been made on how to report the last uncertain  figure, the figure becomes part of the other figures that are known with certainty.  The figures that are obtained after reading offf a piece of equipment are significant - the figures have meaning.  Such meaning cannot always be assigned to numbers that are obtained from calculation  as we will see shortly.
	How2 then do we assign meaning to numbers  that have been obtained by calculation?  If, for example, we want to determine the value of one quarter of the piece above we divide 10.43 cm by 4 and from the calculator we can read the result as 2.6075.
	The most fun damental guiding princeiple is that a calculated result should not have more significant figures than the figure with the least number of significant figures  that was used in the calculation.  The statement is a bit of a mouth but is the most reliable guide especially where n o proper statistical calculation s have been made.  In our example there are four significant figures in 10.43 cm.  The number two is a counting number, which  can have as many significanat figures as we like, 2.02.000 or 2.00000 depending on the situation we are dealing with.  The calculated result should not have more significant figures than 10.43.  We therefore report a quarter of the lengh as 2.608 cm.


</p>

<p>
	The second methos of deciding what to report after making measurements relies on calculating standard deviations. The procedure involved is almost mechanical
	<ol type="a">
		<li>First collect the desired measurements from a burette, spectrophotometer, balance or other piece of eqipment.</li>
		<li>Next you calculate the mean.</li>
		<li>You then calculate the mean. If you use computer software for cal.ulating the mean,you should be  to calculate the standard deviaton of the same time.</li>
		<li>Finally, ensure that the standard deviation include onlhy ONE significant figure.</li>
	</ol>
		Let us say that for our hypothetical piece we had the measurements that are whosn in the table below.  Also whon in the tale are the mean and standard deviation calculated from the measdured values using GraphPad Prism software.
	
</p>
<p>Results obtained from triplicate measurements of an item together with the calculated mean and standard deviation</p>

<table style="border: none;">
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> Trial </th> <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> Measurement (cm) </th>	</tr>
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> One </th> <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> 10.43 </th> </tr>
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> Two</th>	 <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> 10.42 </th> </tr>
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> Three </th> <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> 10.47 </th> </tr>
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> Mean </th> <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> 10.44 </th> </tr>
	<tr>	<th style="border: none;"> Standard deviation </th> <td style="border: none;"></td> <th style="border: none;"> 0.2646 </th> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Ensuring that only one significant figture remains in the vlue of the standard deviation gives 0.03 for the standard deviation.  Any numbers to the right of the 3 in 0.03 do  not have anhy meaning.  We, therefore, report 10.44 <big>&plusmn</big> 0.03 cm as the result of our calculation.  
<br/>
You should appreciate that using only one significanat figure in reporting the standard deviation is related to the fact that in any measurement, you can never be uncertain  about two figures.  
</p>
Follow the above two rules and you will never go wrong.
<ol type="1">
<li>	Determination of the density of an aqueous solution
	<ol type="a">
	<li>  Meaure the temperature of the solution provided with a mercury thermometer.  Record the range of temperatures that appears on the thermometer scale.</li>
	<li>	Dispense about ten ml of the solution into a 25 ml or 20 ml burette.</li>
	<li>	Carefully record the level of the liquid in burette.</li>
	<li>	Dispense about two ml of liquid inot a weighed weighing boat or small glass beaker.</li>
	<li>	Carefully record the new level of the liquid</li>
	<li>	Weigh the boat or beaker to obtin the mass of the dispenseed liquid.</li>
	<li>	Repeat steps 2.c to 2.f two more times so that you will have 3 values for the mass of dispensed liquid and 3 values for the corresponding volumes of liquid dispensed.</li>
	<li>	Use the volumes and masses obtained to calculate the density of the solution as g/ml.</li>
	<li>	Calculate  the mean density</li>
	<li>	Determine the standard deviationfor your result.</li>
	<li>	Report your result on the basis of standard deviation.</li>
	<li>	Report your result on the basis fo significant figures.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>	Measurement of lenght
		<ol type="a">
	<li>	Depending on the situation of the day, you will be provided with plant material that may be fruit, leaves sor stems.</li>
	<li>	Measure the length of ten lealves or other material provided using a metre rule</li>
	<li>	Calculate the mean length of the leaves</li>
	<li>	Determine standard deviation</li>
	<li>	REport your result on the basis of significant figures.</li>
	<li>	Report your result on the basis of the standard deviation.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>	Preparation of the report<br/>
<p>
	Prepare your report following the guidelines that have been posted.  Your ability to ORGANIZE data will contribute to your final mark.
</p>
	Your report should not be more than 1000 words long.  Indicate actual number of words used as the very last item in your report.
