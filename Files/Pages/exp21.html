A STUDY OF ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE ACTION
	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>


Alcohol dehydrogenase (Alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase EC 1.1.1.1). present in a crude extract of Baker's yeast, catalyses the following reactions:

<p>CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH + NAD<sup>+</sup> <big>&#8652;</big> CH<sub>3</sub> - CHO + NADH + H<sup>+</sup></p>

At ph 7.0 the equilibrium is well over to the left and the enzyme might better be described as an aldehyde reductase.  However, at pH 8.5 and a high alcohol concentration, considerable amounts 0f NADH may be formed.  The absorbance of a molar solution of NADH is 6.22 x 10 in a 1cm cell and the reaction is followed bymeasuring the change of absorbance at 340m&micro;.  One international unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme that reduces 1 umole NAD per minute.  The SI unit (called 'the Kala') defined as the amount that causes reduction of 1 mole NAD per second may also be used.

Reagents
<ol type="1">
	<li>66mM NaH2PO, buffer, pH 5.1. keep at 4<sup>o</sup>C </li>
	<li>50mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5</li>
	<li>3 M ethanol, 2.74 ml Ethanol in 10.0 ml.</li>
	<li>15mM NAD<sup>+</sup> (10mg/ml). This solution will be provided</li>
	<li>Dilution solution.  Pyrophosphate buffer containing 1mg/ml protein (BSA) as a protective colloid.
	</li>
</ol>
Extraction Procedure

Place 1.0g active dried yeast in a dry mortar.  Add 0.5g acid washed sand and 1-2 ml of 66mM mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer, pH 5.1. to give a thick slurry.  Grind vigorously for 5 minutes.  Use the remaining buffer to a total of 5.0ml to wash the slurry into a small conical flask.  Incubate the mixture at 37<sup>o</sup>C in a shaking water bath.  After 30 minutes pour off the suspension from the sand into a centrifuge tube and spin for 10min to clarify it as far as possible.  Collect  the supernatant and keep cold on ice.
<p>
Assay Procedure
Place in the cuvette the following		 <u>ml</u>

	50mM pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5		0,5<br>
	15mM NADH 								0.1<br/>
	water 									2.2<br/>
	Diluted yeast extract (try 0.1-2.0)	 <u>0.1</u><br/>
										 <u>2.9</u></p>
<p>
Read the obsorbance at 340nm against a blank of 2.5ml water plu o.5ml buffer.  Start the stop clock and read and record the absorbance at 1 min intervals for 4 min.  The add 0.1ml of 3M ethanol to start the reaction, mix and record the readings over the next 5 min.  If the rate is too fast or too slow, find the final dilution of the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Plot the progress curve for the reaction (absorbance against time from the moment the clock was started), and calculate the initial rate of the reaction in absorbance units per min.
</p>

<p>V against [S] curve<br/>
Using 0.1ml of a suitable dilution of your enzyme (assumed to be 1 ->20) obtain initial velocities as above for the different substrate concentration corresponding to (a) 0.1ml of 3M EtOH (the run you have just done),(b) 0.1ml of 0.6M EtOH. (c) 0.1 ml of 0.3M EtOH (d) 0.1ml of 0.15 M EtOH.
</p>

<p>
	Plot the progress curve for each run, obtain 'V' for each value [S]. Plot V against [S], 1/v against 1/[S] and calculate the k<sub>m</sub> for ethanol.
</p>

<p>
	V against [E] curve<br/>
	Using 0.1 ml of 3M ethanol as substrate, use 0.1ml of (a)0.1 -> 1.0. (b) 0.1 -> 1.5, (c) 0.1 -> 2.0. (d) 0.1 -> 4.0 diluted yeast supernatant making each diluted yeast supernatant making each dilution just before the enzyme assay. Ude dilution solution for the dilutions, Plot V against the amount of enzyme in the cuvette.
</p>

<p>Effect of absence of NAD<sup>+</sup></p>

<p>
	Repeat one of your runs with the addition of 0.1 ml water in place of 0.1 ml 15mM NAD<sup>+</sup>. What does the result indicate?
