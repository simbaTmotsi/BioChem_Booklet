EFFECT OF INHIBITORS ON ENZYME ACTIVITY

	</big>
	</pre>
</h2>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<p>To analyze the effect of increasing inhibitor concentration on the acticity of catechol oxidase</p>

<p>
	Introduction<br/>

	Catechol oxidase is the enzyme responsible for the browning of fruit.  It is easy to prepare from a number of different sources - bananas are particularly good - and the reaction is readly followed using a spectrophotometer.  Catechol oxidase has a number of alternative names.  (Polyphenol oxidate, Diphenol oxidate, Tyrosinase, etc.)  The reaction catalysed is the oxidation of catechol to yellow product 1.2- benzoquinone.  On exposure to air there is a further reaction in which the yellow benzoquinone is converted to dark brown melamin.

	Enzyme extraction
	Catechol oxidase can be extracted from fruits that brown on exposure of their cut surfaces to air, potato and apple are commonly used.  We have found banana to be easiest to use, and the extract retains its activity for weeks in the fridge.  To prepare the enzyme blend banana with two volumes of water or just squash the banana with  a fork and crush it in a pestle and mortar with two volumes of water.  A mass of 20g of banana with 40 mls of water will give plenty of extract for most purposes.  Filer the extract through a filter paper and store refrigerated.  Reaction mixture for  continuous reading, put 0.1 mls of the enzyme extract in a cuvette and add 2.9 mls of a mixture containing 0.5mls of catechol solution and 2.4mls of buffer.  The reaction can be peformed at room temperature.  The optimum pH is around 6.8 and catechol concentrations between 0.01 M and 0.05M (final concentration in the cuvette) should give a good linear response when the concentration is plotted against the rate of reaction.

	Kinetics
	Enzme are protein catalyst that, like all catalyst, speed up the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up in the process.  The study of the rate at which an enzyme work is called enzyme kinetics  as a function of the concentration of substrate (S) available to the enzyme is shown in the figure.  

	Plotting V<sub>i</sub> as a function of (S), we find that
	<ul type="none">
		<li>At low values of (S), the initial velocity, V<sub>i</sub>rises almost linearly with increasing (S).</li>
		<li>The asymptote represents the maximum velocity of the reaction, designated V<sub>max</sub></li>
		<li>The substrate concentration that produces a V<sub>i</sub> that is one-half of V<sub>max</sub> is designated the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km(named after the scientists who developed the study of enzyme kinetics). K<sub>m</sub> is (roughly) an inverse measure of the affinity or strength of binding between the enzyme and its substrate. The loweer the Km, the greater the affinity (so the lower the concentration of substrate needed to achieve a given rate). </li>
	</ul>

<p>
	Enzymes can be inhibited competitively, when the substrate and the inhibitor or compete for binding to the same active site or noncompetitively, when the inhibitor binds somewhere else on the enzyme molecule reducing its efficiency. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor (left panel), it takes a higher substrate concentration to achieve the same velocities that were reached in the absence. So while Vmacx can still be reached if sufficient substrate is available, one-half V<sub>max</sub> requires a higher [S] than before and thus Km is larger. With non-competitive inhibition (right panel), enzyme rate (velocity) is reduced for all values of [S], including V<sub>max</sub> and one half V<sub>max</sub> but Km remains unchanged. A "double-reciprocal" or Lineweaver-Burk plotis usually plottedto determine the kinetic parameters V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> 1

When a slice of apple is exposed to air, it quickly turns brown. This is because the enzyme odiphenol oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of phenols in the apple to dark-colored products.<br>
The V<sub>max</sub> and the Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>m</sub>) for this enzyme are to be determined.

Requirements:
<ol type="1">
	<li>Catechol, 0.05M (Note: Poison do not pipette by mout, use bulb pipettes!) Catechol is a poison. Ude caution handling this chemical. Avoid contact with the solution. If a spill occurs, immediately wipe up the spill with dry paper towels and the use disinfectant solution on the spill site. Be sure to notify your instructor of the spill and your clean-up procedures. </li>
	<li>para-hydroxybenzoic acid, 1mM</li>
	<li>phenythiourea</li>
</ol>

Procedure:<br>
<ul type="none">
<li>Materials Required to prepare the Catechol Oxidase Extract (For the Class):</li>
<li>20 g potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
<li>40ml cold 0.1 M Potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8</li>
<li>250 ml beaker</li>
<li>1 Large funnel</li>
<li>Several layers of cheesecloth</li>
</ul>

<p>Caution!!!!: Please use gloves and face mask mask throughout the experiment</p>

Preparation of the Catechol Oxidase Extract and the inhibitors (Thid will be done in advanve or by the lab staff, your instructor or by student volunteers)
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Peel and chunk the potatoes (or apples/bananas). Put the peeled and chunked potatoes in the blender. Add 40 ml of cold 0.1M Phosphate Buffer and blend at high speed for 2 minutes</li>
	<li>Line the Large funnel with several layers of cheesecloth and place the funnel in the 250 ml beaker, which has been placed in a cointainer of ice. Filter the potato juice through the cheesecloth into the beaker.</li>
	<li>The filtrate is your potato juice-catechol oxidase extract. It will be reffered to simply as "catechol oxidase" throughout the exercises.
	Note: Potatoes also contain catechol, so you will need to keep the catechol oxidase extract on ice at all times during the laboratory to reyard any natural chemical reaction which might occur.
	</li>
	<li>Because of the speed with which colored products are formed, we can use the intensity of the color as a measure of product formation.</li>
